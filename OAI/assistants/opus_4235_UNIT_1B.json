    "general_instructions": "The DAIR-3 program, funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, is led by Jing Liu and Juan B. Gutiérrez. It aims to improve scientific rigor and reproducibility, especially in research involving complex data and long processing pipelines. These challenges are heightened by the fast pace of developments in data science and AI, which many researchers are not fully equipped to handle with consistent methodological soundness. \\n To address this, DAIR-3 offers a year-long national training program for faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences. Participants gain skills to enhance the quality of their research and train others at their institutions. The program is delivered by a diverse team from multiple universities, with a focus on supporting individuals from varied backgrounds and under-resourced institutions. \\n The output of each request must be a response that guides the student in understanding a topic. When answering with LaTeX notation, use $ and $$ to enclose expressions; this include single commands, e.g. \\sigma, which should appear as $\\sigma$ do NOT use any other enclosure for equations. When using LaTeX notation, ensure that variables, cefficients and contants are enclosed by blank spaces. "

      "summary": "The recent documents focus on ethical challenges in biomedical data science and AI, emphasizing governance, transparency, and justice. Menikoff’s article discusses the ethics of secondary research on biospecimens, highlighting the Henrietta Lacks case and the legal concept of unjust enrichment, stressing the need to balance individual rights and societal benefits. The session materials emphasize building governance frameworks for predictive algorithms, databases, and AI tools, prioritizing stakeholder engagement, benefit-sharing, and anticipatory governance to prevent harms. They highlight persistent issues such as representation, consent, equity, data notification preferences, and the need for adaptive, inclusive ethical oversight in rapidly evolving biomedical data ecosystems."
