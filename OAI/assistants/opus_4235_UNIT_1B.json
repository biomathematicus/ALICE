Gutiérrez. It aims to improve scientific rigor and reproducibility, especially in research involving complex data and long processing pipelines. These challenges are heightened by the fast pace of developments in data science and AI, which many researchers are not fully equipped to handle with consistent methodological soundness. \\n To address this, DAIR-3 offers a year-long national training program for faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences. Participants gain skills to enhance the quality of their research and train others at their institutions.  \\n\\n When you respond, I'd like the following to happen:\\n\\n Directive R1: Generate detailed answers without adjectives, unless explicitly asked for.\\n\\n Directive R2: Generate answers in paragraphs instead of lists, unless explicitly asked for.\\n\\n Directive R3: Avoid text with participial phrases.\\n\\n Directive R4: Generate text in paragraphs without sections, unless explicitly asked for. The first sentence of each paragraph should be the main idea, with all other text in the paragraph developing that idea.

     "description": "The combined documents present a comprehensive instructional framework on the ethical challenges in biomedical data science, structured into two sequential sessions. Session 1 introduces foundational concepts by framing ethics and policy as the integration of professional expertise with community values. The session distinguishes between traditional bioethical frameworks and the complexities introduced by sociotechnical systems. It emphasizes that the current data science paradigm often includes expanded uses beyond the original intent, encompassing research, clinical care, administration, and commercial development. This shift introduces strains on existing ethical structures due to diverging values, access disparities, and unequal power across multiple stakeholders. Classical bioethical principles—autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice—remain relevant but insufficient. Sociotechnical analysis is proposed as an expanded lens that incorporates technological interdependencies, upstream and downstream effects, and both individual and population-level consequences. Ethical considerations are broadened to include privacy, group harms, transparency, conflict of interest, equity, and unintended consequences. The session also highlights the AFIRRM principles—adaptivity, flexibility, inclusiveness, reflexivity, responsiveness, and monitoring—as key to navigating ethical tensions in modern data environments. The need for context-sensitive, participatory, and iterative ethical frameworks is presented as urgent. Findings from a study show that public comfort with data use is correlated with trust in institutions and negatively influenced by experiences of discrimination, challenging assumptions embedded in current policies defining “sensitive” data. \\n\\n  Session 2 builds upon these foundations by focusing on ethical issues in the secondary use of data, including anticipatory governance and stakeholder engagement. It underscores institutional challenges arising from an “open ecosystem” involving patients, professionals, and populations, and delineates issues at the individual, organizational, and societal levels. Examples include conflicts of interest, disparities in access, implementation capacity, and the pace of innovation. The rise of large language models introduces new ethical complications, including liability, reproducibility concerns, prompt sensitivity, and the problematic appearance of validity in incorrect results. Current practices often treat secondary use of de-identified data as inherently low-risk, yet cases such as Henrietta Lacks and the Havasupai Tribe illustrate the limitations of that assumption. The Henrietta Lacks case in particular raises unresolved questions about consent, benefit-sharing, and justice. A national survey shows strong public preference for notification about all uses of their data and biospecimens, especially when identifiable, and regardless of whether the use is for research or quality improvement. Public commentary from community meetings reinforces these preferences, revealing deep mistrust rooted in historical exclusion and lack of transparency. Calls for transparency and ethical community engagement are supported by literature advocating participatory approaches to research governance. Anticipatory governance is introduced as a methodology to identify and address potential harms before they manifest. Its principles align with AFIRRM and emphasize relevance, situational awareness, and structure-building. Governance of AI models in academic medical centers is characterized as fragmented, unregulated, and often vulnerable to marketing that obscures statistical limitations. Public trust, clinical outcomes, and operational metrics are cited as areas affected by this fragmented oversight. A qualitative quote illustrates how vendors can market ineffective models due to a lack of statistical oversight, reflecting widespread systemic vulnerability. \\n\\n  Session 2 also incorporates applied exercises, including discussion cases and assessments. One case explores ethical dilemmas related to the commercial use of biobank samples originally collected under broad consent. Questions probe obligations to donors, benefit-sharing strategies, anticipatory preparedness, and needed policy reforms. Another case involves the establishment of community governance for a genomic database in partnership with Hispanic/Latino communities. It asks how to structure shared responsibilities, ensure participatory decision-making, and prioritize policy domains. The session assessment tasks participants with designing a governance framework for one of three data science initiatives: a hospital readmission risk algorithm, a database of health outcomes in underserved communities, or an AI mental health chatbot for college students. Participants must address stakeholder engagement, decision-making structures, monitoring processes, benefit-sharing, consent procedures, and mitigation strategies for unexpected harms. A final reflective component asks how well the framework anticipates future ethical challenges and how resource constraints might limit implementation. This structure reinforces the session's focus on operationalizing ethical principles in real-world institutional contexts. \\n\\n  The peer-reviewed article by Menikoff expands the conversation on secondary use ethics through a focused analysis of Henrietta Lacks’ legacy. While her biospecimens were used without consent, the article argues that the core ethical issue lies in the asymmetry between the enormous societal benefit and the lack of compensation to her family. The article critiques existing legal frameworks, noting that while federal regulations still permit the use of non-identified biospecimens without consent, they fail to address the question of unjust enrichment. Legal actions brought by the Lacks family rely on this concept, which holds that retention of benefits without compensation is inequitable. The article presents historical and theoretical foundations for unjust enrichment and discusses recent judicial decisions that allowed these claims to proceed. The author concludes that while such cases are rare, they offer an opportunity to reconsider ethical norms surrounding uniquely valuable biospecimens. The broader implication is that ethical frameworks should incorporate not only autonomy and beneficence but also distributive justice, particularly when research creates commercial value from biological materials sourced from marginalized communities. Menikoff advocates for renewed dialogue to determine under what circumstances consent and compensation are ethically and legally appropriate, and suggests that incorporating the concept of unjust enrichment could advance both ethical and legal standards in biomedical research (Menikoff, J. (2025). The Second Legacy of Henrietta Lacks. JAMA, 333(16), 1387–1388. [https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.1074](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.1074))."
