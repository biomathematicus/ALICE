    "description": "The Data and AI Intensive Research with Rigor and Reproducibility (DAIR-3) program is funded by Award 5R25GM151182 of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, one of the 27 institutes of the National Institutes of Health of the United States. The principal investigators are Jing Liu (University of Michigan) and Juan B. Guti\u00c3\u00a9rrez (University of Texas at San Antonio). \\nThe rigor of scientific research and the reproducibility of research results are essential for the validity of research findings and the trustworthiness of science. However, research rigor and reproducibility remains a significant challenge across scientific fields, especially for research with complex data types from heterogeneous sources, and long data manipulation pipelines. This is especially critical as data science and artificial intelligence (AI) methods emerge at lightning speed and researchers scramble to seize the opportunities that the new methods bring.  \\n\\nWhile researchers recognize the importance of rigor and reproducibility, they often lack the resources and the technical know-how to achieve this consistently in practice. With funding from the National Institutes of Health, a multi-university team offers a nationwide program to equip faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences with the skills needed to improve the rigor and reproducibility of their research, and help them transfer such skills to their trainees. \\n\\nTrainees will then be guided over a one-year period to incorporate the newly acquired mindset, skills and tools into their research; and develop training for their own institutions.  \\n\\nThe DAIR3 team and instructors include faculty and staff research leaders from the University of Michigan, the College of William and Mary, Jackson State University, and University of Texas San Antonio. This highly diverse team will model the culture of diversity that we promote, and will support trainees who are demographically, professionally and scientifically diverse, and are from a diverse range of institutions, including those with limited resources.",

      "summary": "For decades, it has been the federal law in the US that a re- searcher can perform secondary research with a biospecimen\u2014forexample, use excess tissue that is not needed for clinical purposesafter a biopsy\u2014without obtaining the person\u2019s consent, so long asthe researcher is not given additional information identifying the per-son. During the recent process for modernizing the relevant regu-lations, a proposal was made to flip that rule to require, in the greatmajority of instances, a person\u2019s consent before that type of re-search could be conducted. 1 No doubt the most attention-getting moment in the ensuing de- bate occurred when Rebecca Skloot, whose book on what hap-penedtoLacksandherfamily 2becameabestseller,publishedanop-ed in the New York Times .3Skloot argued that the use of Lacks\u2019 biospeci- men without her consent supported the proposed rule change. 4 The primary cause of action in those lawsuits was \u201cunjust enrich- ment.\u201d While the origin of that cause of action dates back hundredsof years, it remains a very unusual type of claim, characterized as both \u201cunderused\u201d and \u201cundertheorized.\u201d5As the recent court ruling de- scribed Maryland\u2019s version of this law, there are 3 key elements to aclaim: \u201c(1) a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff,(2) an appreciation or knowledge by the defendant of the benefit,and (3) the acceptance or retention by the defendant of the benefitunder such circumstances as to make it inequitable for the defen-dant to retain the benefit without payment of its value.\u201d 4 The possible relevance of this cause of action to what hap- pened to Lacks is shown by an example the court quotes from TheRestatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment (restate-ments being volumes interpreting fields of law that are written bydistinguished legal scholars, practitioners, and judges). But regardless of what happens in that or other lawsuits in the future, these events do provide an opportunity for the research com-munity, policymakers, and the public generally to have a conversa-tion about whether our ethical analysis of biospecimen researchshould take cognizance of the concept of unjust enrichment. That is likely not the type of ethics that the writers of the Belmont Report had in mind in designating justice as 1 of their 3 main con-cerns. Where someone\u2019s biospecimen is uniquely valuable, and itsuse in research will provide great benefits to the public in terms ofnew medical knowledge, sharing the value of those benefits with thatperson would likely strengthen the public\u2019s trust in the legitimacyof research."
