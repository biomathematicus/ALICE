		"description": "This lesson is about the following: Computational reproducibility aims to ensure that an analysis can be exactly replicated, is easy to use and understand, allows for inspection and modification, can be reused, is version controlled, and is permanently archived. The course defines reproducibility in contrast with related terms like repeatability and robustness, emphasizing practical methods to achieve reproducibility in everyday data projects. Major goals include providing complete data and code, defining random seeds, specifying all dependencies, organizing code in notebooks, and using platforms like GitHub and Zenodo for sharing. Tools such as Jupyter, Quarto, git, Docker, and virtual environments like venv and renv support these aims. \\n\\n  Code notebooks are central to reproducible analysis by combining text, code, and output in a literate programming style. Jupyter and Quarto are two primary platforms. Jupyter uses the .ipynb format and supports many programming languages via kernels. Markdown is used to annotate code, and tools like jupytext help convert notebooks to formats suitable for version control. Export options include HTML and executable scripts, enhancing shareability. Quarto supports R, Python, and Julia, with a publishing focus and compatibility with Jupyter. Notebooks help by documenting the analytic process in a narrative format and enabling straightforward export and format conversion, although they may face issues like non-sequential execution and version control complications. \\n\\n  Reproducible programming emphasizes consistent coding practices even under time constraints. Key idioms include scripting all procedures rather than using consoles, refactoring repetitive code into functions, replacing magic numbers with named variables or arguments, caching intermediate results to provide entry points throughout the workflow, and seeding pseudo-random number generators to ensure consistent outputs. The use of makefiles helps manage and document complex pipelines. Randomness should be managed carefully, especially when parallelizing, using tools like future.apply in R. Linting and styling tools, such as lintr and styler, enforce consistent code formatting. Regular maintenance practices such as cleaning pipelines, re-running analyses, and peer code review are recommended for sustainability. \\n\\n  Version control using git supports reproducibility by tracking the history of a project and managing multiple versions, typically via platforms like GitHub. Git is optimized for text files, not binary data or notebooks with embedded outputs. The .gitignore file helps control what is tracked. Strategies like mirroring notebooks to text formats using jupytext and archiving milestone versions in a dedicated directory help manage file versioning. Although git is complex, its basic features are straightforward and highly useful, particularly for individual users rather than just for collaboration. Graphical interfaces like GitHub Desktop and GitKraken are available for those who prefer not to use the command line. \\n\\n  Containers encapsulate the full computational environment, addressing the problem of changing dependencies and inconsistent results over time. Docker and Podman are tools that create containers using a base image, Dockerfile, and user files. Containers save system libraries, programming environments, and packages, ensuring analyses run the same across different platforms. Examples highlight the risk of changes in software behavior, such as R's sample function, impacting reproducibility. Containers are nearly as fast as native execution, share kernels with the host OS, and are easier to distribute than virtual machines. They are suitable for archiving complete environments and can be exported, shared, and reloaded reliably. \\n\\n  Putting the components together, a reproducible analysis should have an organized structure with separate directories for original and processed data, scripts, results, and outputs. Makefiles automate the workflow, defining rules for tasks like downloading data, preprocessing, analysis, and producing outputs. Results should be cached after each step to allow inspection and quick re-runs. The entire pipeline should be executable with a single command. Data retrieval and processing should be automated. Final results must be generated verbatim by the code and embedded in notebooks. Sharing should involve accessible platforms, version synchronization, and linkage between code, data, and containers. Archiving options include GitHub, Zenodo, and Open Science Foundation. A real example of these principles is available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03529](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03529) and its companion GitHub repository [https://github.com/adamSales/rebarLoop](https://github.com/adamSales/rebarLoop)."
