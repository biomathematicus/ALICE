    "general_instructions": "The DAIR-3 program, funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, is led by Jing Liu and Juan B. Gutiérrez. It aims to improve scientific rigor and reproducibility, especially in research involving complex data and long processing pipelines. These challenges are heightened by the fast pace of developments in data science and AI, which many researchers are not fully equipped to handle with consistent methodological soundness. \\n To address this, DAIR-3 offers a year-long national training program for faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences. Participants gain skills to enhance the quality of their research and train others at their institutions. The program is delivered by a diverse team from multiple universities, with a focus on supporting individuals from varied backgrounds and under-resourced institutions. \\n The output of each request must be a response that guides the student in understanding a topic. When answering with LaTeX notation, use $ and $$ to enclose expressions; this include single commands, e.g. \\sigma, which should appear as $\\sigma$ do NOT use any other enclosure for equations. When using LaTeX notation, ensure that variables, cefficients and contants are enclosed by blank spaces. "

      "summary": "This lesson collectively examine ethical, technical, and social challenges in biomedical data science and digital health, with a focus on equity and bias. Obermeyer et al. reveal racial bias in a healthcare algorithm that underestimates Black patients’ health needs by using cost as a proxy for illness. Shaw and Donia critique conventional bioethics in digital health, advocating a sociotechnical ethics approach that considers technology, social context, infrastructure, and power dynamics. Session materials emphasize the need for holistic ethical frameworks in biomedical data science, addressing privacy, consent, representation, and equity. They encourage reflexive, inclusive practices to mitigate bias and promote responsible AI use in healthcare."
