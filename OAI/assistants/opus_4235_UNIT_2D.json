		"description": "This lesson is about the following: Scientific data sharing aims to extend existing knowledge by promoting transparency and accessibility. This is driven both by ethical reasoning and policy mandates such as the NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy, effective from January 2023, which requires researchers to plan for data management and provide justifications when data cannot be shared. The FAIR Data Principles—Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable—provide a framework for evaluating how effectively data are prepared for sharing. These principles emphasize persistent identifiers, rich metadata, standardized access protocols, use of community vocabularies, clear licensing, provenance, and domain-relevant standards. Data should be sufficient to replicate research, including documentation, metadata, and code, but not include drafts, preliminary analyses, or communications. The NIH outlines desirable characteristics for repositories, including sustainability, metadata support, quality assurance, accessibility, clear use policies, and safeguards for security and confidentiality. Researchers must choose repositories based on these characteristics, with domain-specific and generalist options provided. NIH policy also expects a two-page DMS plan with each proposal and mandates compliance reporting. \\n\\n  Implementation of the policy reveals tension between transparency and confidentiality, especially in human subjects research. The “5 Safes” framework provides a model to balance data sharing with privacy by assessing safety across projects, people, data, outputs, and settings. Projects must comply with legal and ethical standards, while people involved must be trained and accountable. Data must minimize identifiable information, outputs must be reviewed for re-identification risks, and secure environments must be maintained for data access. Data sharing differs across research types. Animal model research, such as Nitz’s NSF-funded work on spatial cognition, commits to releasing categorized spike waveform and tracking data with low risk and modest costs. Drug discovery projects, such as an Alzheimer’s study supported by NIA, share physical properties and imaging data unless patent concerns delay disclosure. Human subjects research requires a tiered access system, with data-use agreements reflecting data sensitivity to protect participant confidentiality. \\n\\n Linking datasets across sources can offer comprehensive insight into health and disease, as exemplified by the Jackson Heart Study, but raises identifiability risks when de-identified datasets are combined with other data. This concern is amplified by emerging technologies like large language models and commercial data linkages, which challenge traditional IRB and FDA oversight roles. These complexities necessitate vigilance in ensuring ethical standards while leveraging the full utility of linked biomedical data. \\n\\n Citation: Kaleba, E. O. (2025).
