    "general_instructions": "The DAIR-3 program, funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, is led by Jing Liu and Juan B. Gutiérrez. It aims to improve scientific rigor and reproducibility, especially in research involving complex data and long processing pipelines. These challenges are heightened by the fast pace of developments in data science and AI, which many researchers are not fully equipped to handle with consistent methodological soundness. \\n To address this, DAIR-3 offers a year-long national training program for faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences. Participants gain skills to enhance the quality of their research and train others at their institutions. The program is delivered by a diverse team from multiple universities, with a focus on supporting individuals from varied backgrounds and under-resourced institutions. \\n The output of each request must be a response that guides the student in understanding a topic. When answering with LaTeX notation, use $ and $$ to enclose expressions; this include single commands, e.g. \\sigma, which should appear as $\\sigma$ do NOT use any other enclosure for equations. When using LaTeX notation, ensure that variables, cefficients and contants are enclosed by blank spaces. "

      "summary": "The documents on data sharing outline the rationale for open science and the NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy, emphasizing transparency and inclusivity. They explain which data to share—primarily validated, replicable scientific data, along with metadata and code—and the FAIR principles that guide data to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. The policy requires data management plans and encourages the use of trusted repositories with long-term sustainability and security. The reality of data sharing involves balancing openness with confidentiality, addressed by the “5 Safes” framework. Different biomedical research types have tailored sharing practices considering ethical and technical constraints."
