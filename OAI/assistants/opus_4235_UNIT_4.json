    "general_instructions": "The DAIR-3 program, funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, is led by Jing Liu and Juan B. Guti√©rrez. It aims to improve scientific rigor and reproducibility, especially in research involving complex data and long processing pipelines. These challenges are heightened by the fast pace of developments in data science and AI, which many researchers are not fully equipped to handle with consistent methodological soundness. \\n To address this, DAIR-3 offers a year-long national training program for faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences. Participants gain skills to enhance the quality of their research and train others at their institutions. The program is delivered by a diverse team from multiple universities, with a focus on supporting individuals from varied backgrounds and under-resourced institutions. \\n The output of each request must be a response that guides the student in understanding a topic. When answering with LaTeX notation, use $ and $$ to enclose expressions; this include single commands, e.g. \\sigma, which should appear as $\\sigma$ do NOT use any other enclosure for equations. When using LaTeX notation, ensure that variables, cefficients and contants are enclosed by blank spaces. "

      "summary": "The lectures cover core biomedical data science methods focused on dimension reduction, clustering, classification, and AI bias. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces correlated variables into uncorrelated components for data simplification and visualization. Clustering groups similar data points without pre-existing labels, using distance metrics like Euclidean or Manhattan distances and methods such as k-means or hierarchical clustering. Classification involves supervised learning to predict known labels, with techniques to avoid overfitting and methods to validate classifiers. The materials also discuss AI biases, the need for dataset transparency via datasheets, model reporting standards (TRIPOD+AI), and uncertainty quantification to improve trust and fairness in biomedical AI applications."
