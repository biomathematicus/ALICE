		"description": "This lesson is about the following: The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is a long-term, community-based, single-site observational study initiated to address the high burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among African Americans. It began in 1998 and recruited 5,306 African American participants from the Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan area, encompassing Hinds, Madison, and Rankin counties. The core objectives include identifying genetic, psychosocial, and environmental risk factors for CVD, engaging in extensive community outreach and education to promote healthy living, and training students from underrepresented groups in biomedical research. \\n\\n  The study has been structured around multiple examination periods: Exam 1 (2000–2004), Exam 2 (2005–2008), Exam 3 (2009–2013), and an ongoing Exam 4 (2020–present). Each exam involves clinical visits that include consent, specimen collection, standardized questionnaires, and physical assessments. In addition to in-person visits, annual follow-up calls assess changes in participants’ health, and hospitalizations are tracked using medical records, vital statistics, and the National Death Index. \\n\\n  The JHS collects a wide range of data types, including clinical, survey, genetic, environmental, and psychosocial measures. Baseline data include physical examinations, interviews, and lab tests capturing information on activity levels, stress, spirituality, discrimination, socioeconomic factors, and health access. Biomarkers measured include lipids, creatinine, glucose, aldosterone, and inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Genetic data include exome and whole-genome sequencing, with specific attention to variants prevalent among African Americans, such as those in APOL1 and PCSK9. \\n\\n  The data dictionary accompanying the study outlines variables across numerous domains. Demographic variables include age, sex, and smoking status. Anthropometrics encompass height, weight, BMI, and circumferences. Medication data cover blood pressure, diabetes, statins, hormone therapy, and others. Disease status is classified for hypertension, diabetes, CVD, renal function, respiratory measures, echocardiographic indices, electrocardiographic readings, and CT imaging of coronary and abdominal vasculature. Psychosocial indicators include education, income, stress, depression, and experiences of discrimination. \\n\\n  The study supports reproducible research by making detailed variable-level documentation available in its analysis dataset warehouse. Variables are labeled consistently across exams, and derived indicators (e.g., “Ever” and “Hx” variables) are created to capture longitudinal patterns of disease history and treatment exposure. For example, “StrokeHx” identifies participants ever diagnosed with stroke, while “DialysisEver” flags those who reported having undergone dialysis at any point. \\n\\n  The process for accessing JHS data for manuscript development involves submitting data use requests, adhering to ethical protocols, and understanding the organizational structure of the dataset. Detailed forms and manuals for each exam visit support the reproducibility and standardization of research. Tools such as the Framingham and Reynolds risk scores, along with AHA’s Life’s Simple 7 metrics, are included to evaluate cardiovascular risk comprehensively. \\n\\n  The JHS emphasizes transparency, rigor, and inclusion in its mission to address cardiovascular health disparities among African Americans. It is supported by detailed documentation, structured datasets, and robust governance to facilitate wide use in population research. The study and its design have been discussed in prior peer-reviewed literature: Fuqua SR, Wyatt SB, Andrew ME, Sarpong DF, Henderson FR, Cunningham MF, et al. (2005).
