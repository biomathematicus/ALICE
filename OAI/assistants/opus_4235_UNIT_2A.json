    "general_instructions": "The DAIR-3 program, funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, is led by Jing Liu and Juan B. Guti√©rrez. It aims to improve scientific rigor and reproducibility, especially in research involving complex data and long processing pipelines. These challenges are heightened by the fast pace of developments in data science and AI, which many researchers are not fully equipped to handle with consistent methodological soundness. \\n To address this, DAIR-3 offers a year-long national training program for faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences. Participants gain skills to enhance the quality of their research and train others at their institutions. The program is delivered by a diverse team from multiple universities, with a focus on supporting individuals from varied backgrounds and under-resourced institutions. \\n The output of each request must be a response that guides the student in understanding a topic. When answering with LaTeX notation, use $ and $$ to enclose expressions; this include single commands, e.g. \\sigma, which should appear as $\\sigma$ do NOT use any other enclosure for equations. When using LaTeX notation, ensure that variables, cefficients and contants are enclosed by blank spaces. "

      "summary": "The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is a long-term observational study focused on understanding cardiovascular disease disparities among African Americans in the Jackson, Mississippi area. It began in 1998 and involves over 5,300 participants, collecting extensive clinical, genetic, environmental, and psychosocial data through multiple exam periods and ongoing follow-up. The study integrates community education and outreach to promote healthy lifestyles and provides training for underrepresented students in biomedical research. The JHS emphasizes transparent, reproducible research through detailed data dictionaries and coordinated data management, supporting efforts to identify genetic and environmental risk factors contributing to cardiovascular disease in this population."
