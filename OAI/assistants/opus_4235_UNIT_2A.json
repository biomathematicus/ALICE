    "description": "The Data and AI Intensive Research with Rigor and Reproducibility (DAIR\u00b3) program is funded by Award 5R25GM151182 of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, one of the 27 institutes of the National Institutes of Health of the United States. The principal investigators are Jing Liu (University of Michigan) and Juan B. Guti\u00e9rrez (University of Texas at San Antonio). \\nThe rigor of scientific research and the reproducibility of research results are essential for the validity of research findings and the trustworthiness of science. However, research rigor and reproducibility remains a significant challenge across scientific fields, especially for research with complex data types from heterogeneous sources, and long data manipulation pipelines. This is especially critical as data science and artificial intelligence (AI) methods emerge at lightning speed and researchers scramble to seize the opportunities that the new methods bring.  \\n\\nWhile researchers recognize the importance of rigor and reproducibility, they often lack the resources and the technical know-how to achieve this consistently in practice. With funding from the National Institutes of Health, a multi-university team offers a nationwide program to equip faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences with the skills needed to improve the rigor and reproducibility of their research, and help them transfer such skills to their trainees. \\n\\nTrainees will then be guided over a one-year period to incorporate the newly acquired mindset, skills and tools into their research; and develop training for their own institutions.  \\n\\nThe DAIR3 team and instructors include faculty and staff research leaders from the University of Michigan, the College of William and Mary, Jackson State University, and University of Texas San Antonio. This highly diverse team will model the culture of diversity that we promote, and will support trainees who are demographically, professionally and scientifically diverse, and are from a diverse range of institutions, including those with limited resources.",

The Jackson Heart Study Population \u20225306 African Americans participants were recruited from Jackson, MS  metropolitan area (Hinds, Madison, and Rankin counties) \u200b The Jackson Heart Study Exam Periods \u20225306 African Americans participants were recruited from Jackson, MS  metropolitan area (Hinds, Madison, and Rankin counties) \u200b \u2022Exam 1 \u20222000 to 2004 \u2022Exam 2 \u20222005 to 2008 \u2022Exam 3 \u20222009- 2013 \u2022Exam 4 ( currently ongoing)JHS Data Collection Cohorts by Periods \u2022Exam Center visits (consents, collection of specimens, questionnaires,  clinic procedures) \u2022Visit 1:  2000 \u20132004 (n=5306, 42 months) \u2022Visit 2:  2005 \u20132008 (n=4203, 38 months) \u2022Visit 3:  2009 \u20132013 (n=3819, 47 months) \u2022Visit 4:  2020 \u2013current JHS Data Collection \u2022Annual contacts to assess changes in health status \u2022Participants/proxies are contacted annually (AFU) by phone   \u2022Ongoing surveillance for CVD and mortality \u2022Hospitalizations for CVD (CHD, heart failure, stroke) \u2022Medical records of hospitalizations for CVD are abstracted for  adjudication \u2022Vital records and National Death IndexTypes of Data Collected in the JHS \u2022Data collection at the baseline exam included a medical history,  physical examination, blood/urine analytes and interview questions  on areas such as:  \u2022physical activity; stress, coping and spirituality; racism and  discrimination; socioeconomic status; and health care access.Types of Data Collected in the JHS \u2022Phenotype -psychosocial, sleep, medical history, sociodemographic, etc. Describe the variables chosen and their rationale.Topic 2: The Process of Manuscript Development in the Jackson Heart  Study Objective: Explain Data Access Procedures \u2013 Describe the process for requesting and obtaining  JHS data, including data use agreements and ethical considerations. The role of the P&P subcommittee is: \u2022To ensure that abstracts, presentations, and publications based on JHS are accurate and objective, and do not compromise the scientific integrity of the study; \u2022To ensure that all investigators, particularly those who are from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups and those who are early career, participate in JHS papers; \u2022To establish procedures that allow for timely review of JHS publications and presentations; \u2022To prevent overlap of published material, approved proposals, and duplication of analyses; \u2022To stimulate scientific presentations and papers from investigators.How to Access JHS Data \u2022Manuscript proposal \u2022Ancillary Study proposal Data Access \u2022Data Request Form Analytic Data \u2022JHS Website:  https://www.jacksonheartstudy.org/ Data Access:   \u2022https://www.jacksonheartstudy.org/Research/Study -Data/Data -AccessJackson Heart Study Publications & Data Use \u2022JHS Data Access  \u2022Directly from JHS for approved proposals \u2022 Data from Coordinating Center  \u2022\u2022 Specimens from Central Lab \u2022NIH BioLINCC (Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating  Center) \u2022\u2022 JHS Phenotype datasets (non- omics) \u2022 3.
