Gutiérrez. It aims to improve scientific rigor and reproducibility, especially in research involving complex data and long processing pipelines. These challenges are heightened by the fast pace of developments in data science and AI, which many researchers are not fully equipped to handle with consistent methodological soundness. \\n To address this, DAIR-3 offers a year-long national training program for faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences. Participants gain skills to enhance the quality of their research and train others at their institutions.  \\n\\n When you respond, I'd like the following to happen:\\n\\n Directive R1: Generate detailed answers without adjectives, unless explicitly asked for.\\n\\n Directive R2: Generate answers in paragraphs instead of lists, unless explicitly asked for.\\n\\n Directive R3: Avoid text with participial phrases.\\n\\n Directive R4: Generate text in paragraphs without sections, unless explicitly asked for. The first sentence of each paragraph should be the main idea, with all other text in the paragraph developing that idea. The addition of first sentences of each paragraph should be equivalent to an abstract.\\n\\n Directive R5: Avoid the following words and never use them: Delve, Tapestry, Vibrant, Landscape, Realm, Embark, Excels, Vital, Weave, Tapestry, Intertwined, Truly, Fleeting, Enchanting, Amidst, Portrayal, Artful, Painted, Seizing, Trusted, Vision, Unfolding, Strive, Ever-evolving, Seamless, Compelling, Marveled, Subtlest, Transcends, Unlock, Unleash, Unveiling, Vast.\\n\\n Directive R6: If the user requests information related to a topic that has no relation to this lesson, inform the user that only information relevant to the lesson will be discussed.",
     "description": "This lesson centers on the ethical governance of biomedical data science, particularly focusing on secondary use of biospecimens and data, anticipatory governance, and equitable stakeholder engagement. It explores how research institutions should develop governance frameworks that manage ethical risks, encourage transparency, and maintain public trust. Through multiple case studies, the lesson underscores the importance of consent, benefit-sharing, and long-term accountability when handling data that originates from individuals or communities, especially marginalized groups. It encourages proactive design of decision-making structures, monitoring systems, and stakeholder involvement procedures to ensure that data science initiatives align with public expectations and ethical norms.\\n\\n    One strength of the lesson is its emphasis on anticipatory governance, which calls for early identification and mitigation of ethical risks before they materialize. This approach is supported by the AFIRRM principles—adaptivity, flexibility, inclusiveness, reflexivity, responsiveness, and monitoring—which offer a framework for institutions to build ethical foresight into the lifecycle of their projects. The lesson also makes effective use of empirical data, such as the NORC AmeriSpeak Panel findings, which demonstrate that most individuals, regardless of the identifiability of their data, prefer to be notified of all uses of their health information and biospecimens. This data challenges common assumptions in policy and practice that de-identification is sufficient for ethical secondary use.\\n\\n    The historical examples of the Havasupai Tribe and Henrietta Lacks reinforce the risks of proceeding without informed consent and community engagement. These cases illustrate how legal compliance is insufficient when public trust and moral accountability are at stake. They also serve as reference points for advocating greater transparency and inclusion in data science research, especially where commercial interests intersect with public goods.\\n\\n    The lesson also introduces the legal and ethical significance of unjust enrichment through the work of Jerry Menikoff. His manuscript examines the Henrietta Lacks case to highlight how ethical frameworks in biomedical research might fail to address scenarios where biospecimens yield extraordinary commercial or scientific value. Menikoff explains that, under current U.S. law, secondary use of non-identified biospecimens is permitted without consent. Efforts to change this rule were defeated on grounds that requiring consent in all cases would delay or restrict important medical research. Menikoff accepts this outcome as reasonable in most cases, noting that the ethical tradeoff between autonomy and beneficence can support secondary use without consent.\\n\\n    However, he identifies a gap in how justice is applied, particularly when research disproportionately benefits institutions or companies while excluding individuals or families—often low-income or marginalized—from any share in those benefits. Menikoff proposes unjust enrichment as a legal framework that can address this disparity. He outlines its three requirements: a benefit must be conferred, the recipient must know about it, and it must be inequitable for the recipient to retain it without compensation. He applies this logic to biospecimens of rare or exceptional value, like Lacks’ tumor, suggesting that researchers should consider the ethical implications of using such material without consent. He argues that these rare cases call for a reevaluation of justice in research ethics, one that includes financial and moral recognition of the source individuals.\\n\\n    The combined materials' strengths lie in their synthesis of governance theory, stakeholder analysis, and empirical research. They also introduce legal reasoning to supplement bioethical discourse, which often focuses more on consent and autonomy than on redistribution or justice. The lesson promotes critical reflection on existing institutional norms, encouraging the development of structures that are not only legally compliant but also ethically credible and socially responsive.\\n\\n    Despite its strengths, the lesson exhibits certain limitations. The proposed governance models are complex and may be challenging to implement, particularly under budgetary or institutional constraints. The tension between inclusivity and feasibility remains unresolved. While the lesson recognizes structural inequities, it does not offer a concrete pathway for redistributing decision-making power or resources between institutions and marginalized communities. Additionally, the concept of anticipatory governance presupposes a capacity to foresee and manage emerging risks, though many risks in data science and AI remain opaque or contested.\\n\\n    In summary, this lesson offers a comprehensive framework for addressing ethical issues in biomedical data science by integrating anticipatory governance, legal analysis, and community engagement. It challenges conventional assumptions about de-identification, consent, and regulatory sufficiency, urging institutions to develop systems that are ethically sound and aligned with public values. The manuscript by Menikoff adds depth by introducing the legal concept of unjust enrichment to argue for a more equitable distribution of benefits in rare but ethically significant cases.\\n\\n    **Citation**: Menikoff, J.
