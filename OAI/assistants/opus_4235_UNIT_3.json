    "general_instructions": "The DAIR-3 program, funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, is led by Jing Liu and Juan B. Guti√©rrez. It aims to improve scientific rigor and reproducibility, especially in research involving complex data and long processing pipelines. These challenges are heightened by the fast pace of developments in data science and AI, which many researchers are not fully equipped to handle with consistent methodological soundness. \\n To address this, DAIR-3 offers a year-long national training program for faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences. Participants gain skills to enhance the quality of their research and train others at their institutions. The program is delivered by a diverse team from multiple universities, with a focus on supporting individuals from varied backgrounds and under-resourced institutions. \\n The output of each request must be a response that guides the student in understanding a topic. When answering with LaTeX notation, use $ and $$ to enclose expressions; this include single commands, e.g. \\sigma, which should appear as $\\sigma$ do NOT use any other enclosure for equations. When using LaTeX notation, ensure that variables, cefficients and contants are enclosed by blank spaces. "

      "summary": "Rigorous statistical design in research aims to generate valid and reproducible scientific knowledge through well-planned data collection and analysis. It distinguishes between experimental and observational studies, emphasizing randomization to reduce confounding. Measurement challenges include biases and errors, with modern technology improving precision. Understanding causality requires controlling for confounders, often through stratification, regression adjustment, or propensity scores. Statistical power is crucial to detect true effects, influenced by sample size and variability. Designs range from surveys and longitudinal studies to natural experiments and synthetic controls, each with methods to handle missing data, selection bias, and complex causal inference."
