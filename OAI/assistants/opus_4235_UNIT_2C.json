    "general_instructions": "The DAIR-3 program, funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, is led by Jing Liu and Juan B. Gutiérrez. It aims to improve scientific rigor and reproducibility, especially in research involving complex data and long processing pipelines. These challenges are heightened by the fast pace of developments in data science and AI, which many researchers are not fully equipped to handle with consistent methodological soundness. \\n To address this, DAIR-3 offers a year-long national training program for faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences. Participants gain skills to enhance the quality of their research and train others at their institutions. The program is delivered by a diverse team from multiple universities, with a focus on supporting individuals from varied backgrounds and under-resourced institutions. \\n The output of each request must be a response that guides the student in understanding a topic. When answering with LaTeX notation, use $ and $$ to enclose expressions; this include single commands, e.g. \\sigma, which should appear as $\\sigma$ do NOT use any other enclosure for equations. When using LaTeX notation, ensure that variables, cefficients and contants are enclosed by blank spaces. "

      "summary": "The files discuss data representation and management in biomedical research. The PHF form captures detailed clinical data on heart failure patients for longitudinal studies like the Jackson Heart Study. Effective data representation involves choosing formats—relational databases, spreadsheets, or knowledge graphs—that balance simplicity and richness. Simplifying data enables easier analysis but risks losing nuanced information. Proper organization, normalization, and indexing improve data retrieval and performance. Outliers require careful evaluation to avoid discarding valuable information. The materials emphasize thoughtful data design for reliable analysis and highlight the complexity of translating raw clinical data into structured, usable datasets for research."
