    "description": "The Data and AI Intensive Research with Rigor and Reproducibility (DAIR\u00b3) program is funded by Award 5R25GM151182 of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, one of the 27 institutes of the National Institutes of Health of the United States. The principal investigators are Jing Liu (University of Michigan) and Juan B. Guti\u00e9rrez (University of Texas at San Antonio). \\nThe rigor of scientific research and the reproducibility of research results are essential for the validity of research findings and the trustworthiness of science. However, research rigor and reproducibility remains a significant challenge across scientific fields, especially for research with complex data types from heterogeneous sources, and long data manipulation pipelines. This is especially critical as data science and artificial intelligence (AI) methods emerge at lightning speed and researchers scramble to seize the opportunities that the new methods bring.  \\n\\nWhile researchers recognize the importance of rigor and reproducibility, they often lack the resources and the technical know-how to achieve this consistently in practice. With funding from the National Institutes of Health, a multi-university team offers a nationwide program to equip faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences with the skills needed to improve the rigor and reproducibility of their research, and help them transfer such skills to their trainees. \\n\\nTrainees will then be guided over a one-year period to incorporate the newly acquired mindset, skills and tools into their research; and develop training for their own institutions.  \\n\\nThe DAIR3 team and instructors include faculty and staff research leaders from the University of Michigan, the College of William and Mary, Jackson State University, and University of Texas San Antonio. This highly diverse team will model the culture of diversity that we promote, and will support trainees who are demographically, professionally and scientifically diverse, and are from a diverse range of institutions, including those with limited resources.",

      "summary": "\u2022Meta analysis is a speci\ufb01c type of research synthesis in which the aim is to quantify a speci\ufb01c parameter or test a speci\ufb01c hypothesis of interest, using results from multiple quantitative sources, and objectively assessing uncertainty for all claims. \u2022One version of the pooled estimate is the simple average of the estimates, $\\hat{\\theta}_a = (\\hat{\\theta}_1 + \\hat{\\theta}_2)/2$. The factor $\\sqrt{(s_1\u02c62 + s_2\u02c62)/2}$ is the standard deviation derived from the average variance. The factor of 1$1/\\sqrt{2}$ is the improvement in precision that results from pooling evidence from two independent studies. \u2022If the standard errors are equal, i.e. $s_1 = s_2$, then the unweighted and weighted pooled estimators are the same. If $H$ is the harmonic mean of the study-level variances, then the standard deviation of the inverse variance weighted average is $H\u02c6{1/2}/\\sqrt{2}$. \u2022If we are pooling $k$ independent estimates, the standard error of the inverse variance weighted average is $H\u02c6{1/2}/\\sqrt{k}$, where $H$ is the harmonic mean of the $k$ study-level variances. \u2022We can pool the data and re-analyze it as a single data set, but it is important to be aware of heterogeneity (systematic di\ufb00erences) among the studies. \u2013Include both negative and positive \ufb01ndings \u2013Reporting of quantitative \ufb01ndings (point estimates, standard errors) \u2013Reporting of methods \u2013De\ufb01nition of target study population, and inclusion/exclusion criteria \u2013Handling of confounding factors \u2013Generally exclude studies that are themselves research syntheses \u2013Multiple studies of the same subject pool are not independent \u2013Multiple studies by the same research team may not be independent \u2013Is it possible to include unpublished studies (pre-registration may make this possible) \u2013Publication language \u2013Select by date? This is a formalized process in which a null hypothesis is speci\ufb01ed and we quantify evidence against the null hypothesis using a test statistic. \u2013The fact that underpins most p-value combining procedures is that if the null hypothesis is true, the p-value follows a uniform distribution on the interval $(0, 1)$. \u2013The classical method for non-independent p-values is the Bonferroni method, which uses the value of $m\\times {\\rm min}(p_1, \\ldots, p_m)$ as a meta p-value. Under the global null hypothesis, $T$ follows a standard Cauchy distribution, and therefore can be transformed to a p-value using the CDF of the reference distribution. \u2022In some cases, it may be reasonable to presume that there is a single com- mon treatment e\ufb00ect, that is, all of the $\\theta_i$ are equal to a common value $\\theta$. As discussed above, the value of $\\theta$ is e\ufb03ciently estimated using the inverse variance weighted mean of the individual study estimates, which we denote $\\hat{\\theta}$. \u2022To account for study heterogeneity, a common approach to meta-analysis is therandom e\ufb00ects orhierarchical approach, in which we posit the model $\\hat{\\theta}_i = \\theta_i + s_i\\epsilon_i$, where the $\\theta_i$ are treated as random variables from a distribution with mean $\\theta$ and variance $\\tau\u02c62$, and the $\\epsilon_i$ are also random variables that are independent of the $\\theta_i$ and that follow a distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1$. \u2013Sometimes we allow the $\\epsilon_i$ to have variance $\\sigma\u02c62$, to account for systematic biases in the reported standard errors. According to the law of total variation, the population variance of the $\\hat{\\theta}_j$ is $\\sigma\u02c62 + \\tau\u02c62$. The statistic $I\u02c62 = \\tau\u02c62 / (\\tau\u02c62 + \\sigma\u02c62)$ is a measure of the proportion of total variance due to study heterogeneity. In a small meta-analysis (with few studies), the sample estimate $\\hat{I}\u02c62$ is biased and its con\ufb01dence interval under-covers the true $I\u02c62$, see here for more details. If truncation is performed, the bias is positive, and is around 0.15 for very small meta-analyses, and becomes smaller as the number of studies in the meta-analysis grows. 6Meta regression \u2022When study characteristics have been quanti\ufb01ed in a consistent way across studies, it is possible to \"partial out\" the contributions of speci\ufb01c study characteristics to the overall heterogeneity. This model should be \ufb01t with generalized least squares using inverse variance weights, with the variances being the squares of the reported standard error for each study e\ufb00ect. Then the treatment e\ufb00ect for populations excluding subjects with prior treatment is $\\beta_1 + \\beta_3$, while the treatment e\ufb00ect for populations that do not make this exclusion is $\\beta_1$. Network meta-analysis \u2022In a basic two-arm study, the treatment e\ufb00ect is often estimated by taking the average response among treated subjects and subtracting from it the average response among control subjects. If study or study/arm characteristics are known, let $Z_{ij}$ be a vector of characteristics for arm $j$ in study $i$, and use a mean structure model such as $E[Y_{ij}] = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + \\gamma\u02c6\\prime Z_{ij}$ The overall model would be $Y_{ij} = E[Y_{ij}] + s_{ij}\\epsilon_{ij}$, where $s_{ij}$ is the reported standard error for $Y_{ij}$ and the $\\epsilon_{ij}$ are independent unit-standard deviation random terms capturing unexplained variation. If sample sizes are reported but standard errors are not, it is possible to model the variance as ${\\rm Var}[Y_{ij}] \\propto 1/n_{ij}$, where $n_{ij}$ is the sample size. When there are large number of treatments, we can visualize the data as a graph, where treatments $j$ and $k$ are connected in the graph if these two treatments are ever present in the same trial. \u2022One potential source of selection bias in meta-analysis at the level of the studies (not the subjects) is publication bias. This refers to the possibility that inconclusive studies or studies that contradict the dominant narrative are less likely to be published than studies that support the consensus point of view. \u2022If all studies are assessing the same e\ufb00ect, then the scatter of the standard error of the estimated treatment e\ufb00ect (on the vertical axis) against the estimated treatment e\ufb00ect (on the horizontal axis) can be used to assess publication bias. \u2022Some funnel plots use the precision as the vertical coordinate rather than the standard error (the precision is the reciprocal of the standard error). \u2022The logic behind a funnel plot is that any given quantile of the e\ufb00ect estimates should scale linearly with the standard error. \u2022Publication bias may be re\ufb02ected in an empty region in the funnel plot, usually corresponding to studies with higher standard error that contradict the hoped-for narrative."

Heerspink20 & the CKD-EPI Clinical Trials  Consortium* Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline is causally associated with kidney  failure and is a candidate surrogate endpoint for clinical trials of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. In an analysis of individual participant data, for each of 66 studies (total of 186,312 participants), we estimated treatment effects on the total GFR slope, computed from baseline to 3\u2009years, and chronic slope, starting at 3\u2009months after randomization, and on the clinical endpoint (doubling of serum creatinine, GFR\u2009<\u200915\u2009ml\u2009min \u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 or kidney  failure with replacement therapy). We used a Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression model to relate treatment effects on GFR slope with those on the clinical endpoint across all studies and by disease groups (diabetes, glomerular diseases, CKD or cardiovascular diseases). Treatment effects on the clinical endpoint were strongly associated with treatment effects on total slope (median coefficient of determination (R 2)\u2009=\u20090.97 (95% Bayesian  credible interval (BCI) 0.82\u20131.00)) and moderately associated with those on chronic slope (R 2\u2009=\u20090.55 (95% BCI 0.25\u20130.77)). A critical challenge in the evalu - ation of therapies for CKD is that randomized controlled trials (RCTs)  traditionally use kidney failure and doubling of serum creatinine as  clinical endpoints, which are often late events in the progression of  CKD2.

Over the full study duration,  a total of 11,396 (6.1%) patients reached the primary clinical endpoint,  defined as the composite of kidney failure with replacement therapy  (KFRT) (initiation of chronic treatment with dialysis or kidney trans - plantation); sustained GFR\u2009<\u200915\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2; or doubling of  serum creatinine (equivalent to 57% decline in GFR). Across all of the stud- ies, as well as for studies in diabetes, CKD and GN, but not for CVD,  an average benefit of treatment was observed (Fig. We also evaluated the treatment effect on the second - ary clinical endpoint, defined as the composite of KFRT or sustained GFR\u2009<\u200915\u2009ml\u2009min \u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2. In the overall set of studies, as well as for  studies in diabetes, CKD, GN and CVD, an average benefit of treatment  was observed (Extended Data Table 3). Trial-level analysis in the overall study population We used Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression analyses to relate the  treatment effects on the clinical endpoint to the treatment effects on the total and chronic GFR slopes across the 66 studies 41. We observed  a strong agreement between the treatment effects on the 3-year total  slope and on the clinical endpoint, with a coefficient of determination  (R2) of 0.97 (95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI) 0.82\u20131.00) (Fig. The slope of the meta-regression line was \u22120.35\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per  1.73\u2009m2 per year (95% BCI \u22120.42 to \u22120.29), indicating that a 0.75\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121  per 1.73\u2009m2 per year greater beneficial effect of the treatment on the  total GFR slope is associated with an average 23.3% lower HR for the clin - ical endpoint (95% BCI 19.3\u201327.2%). The intercept of the meta-regression  was \u22120.04 (95% BCI \u22120.09 to 0.01), indicating that, in the absence of a  treatment effect on the 3-year total slope, the average treatment effect  on the clinical endpoint is likely to be small (that is, 95% probability for  the HR to be between 0.91 and 1.01). The treatment effect on the  2-year total slope similarly showed a strong association with the treat - ment effect on the clinical endpoint (R2 of 0.87 (95% BCI 0.64\u20130.97))  (Extended Data Fig. However, the inter- cept was smaller than 0 (\u22120.11 (95% BCI \u22120.17 to \u22120.06)), indicating that  a small average benefit on the clinical endpoint can be expected even in the absence of a treatment effect on the 2-year total slope. The slope of the meta-regression line dif- fered substantially from 0, at \u22120.33 (95% BCI \u22120.46 to \u22120.20), indicating  that a 0.75\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year greater beneficial treatment  effect on the total GFR slope is associated with an average 21.8% lower  hazard for the clinical endpoint (95% BCI 14.1\u201329.4%). The intercept of  the regression line is nearly indistinguishable from 0 (\u22120.01, 95% BCI  \u22120.10 to 0.10), indicating low risk of a false-negative conclusion of the  absence of a treatment effect on the clinical endpoint when there is no  treatment effect on chronic slope (that is, 95% probability for the HR to be between 0.90 and 1.10). Trial-level analyses for the secondary clinical endpoint We evaluated associations between the treatment effects on GFR  slope with those on the secondary clinical endpoint. For the total  slope, compared to the analysis of the primary clinical endpoint, the  median R2 decreased from 0.97 (0.82, 1.00) to 0.92 (0.56, 0.99). For  the chronic slope, the median R2 increased from 0.55 (0.25, 0.77) to strongly associated with subsequent kidney failure across subgroups of  age, sex and diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease status  failure4\u20137. Using a smaller number of RCTs, we previously demonstrated  that treatment effects on the GFR slope were highly predictive of treat - ment effects on clinical endpoints in hypothetical future RCTs8. On the  basis of this evidence, GFR slope has been used to evaluate efficacy of  treatments in less common conditions, such as glomerular diseases9\u201313,  or when treatments with established efficacy and safety in one popu-lation are expanded to another population 14. However, there remains  uncertainty as to the use of GFR slope in more common causes of kidney  diseases and across severity of kidney disease, further limiting evalua - tion of new therapies in many kidney disease settings. RCTs in populations with earlier stages of CKD or populations at  risk for CKD evaluated the efficacy of novel agents for prevention of  adverse outcomes, including mortality, heart failure events and CKD progression 15\u201333. These studies provide the opportunity to evaluate if  the strong associations between treatment effects on GFR slope with  those on the clinical endpoint persist with inclusion of more diverse  interventions and populations. Together, these data have the potential to strengthen the evidence  for the validity of GFR slope as a surrogate endpoint for kidney failure,  providing support for its use as a primary endpoint for trials of CKD  progression across a broad series of settings. Studies of patients with CKD from other causes or cause not speci - fied reported lower mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  than the studies of patients with diabetes, glomerular diseases (glo - merulonephritis (GN)) or cardiovascular disease (CVD), and studies of  patients with CVD reported lower levels of urine albumin-to-creatinine  ratio (ACR) and slower progression than the other disease groups (Table 1   and Supplementary Table 4). Compared to the previous set of stud - ies, the current studies include populations with higher mean levels  of GFR and populations at high risk for CVD (Extended Data Table 1). Treatment effects on the GFR slope and the clinical endpoint Patterns of change in GFR (GFR slope) after initiation of an interven - tion are often nonlinear, with possibly differing direction and rates  of changes in early follow-up (herein called acute slope) versus  longer-term follow-up (herein called chronic slope)39. The average  rate of decline from the beginning to the end of the study incorporates  both elements (herein called total slope). We used a shared-parameter  mixed-effects model to estimate the effects of the treatment on the  total GFR slope at 3\u2009years (herein called 3-year total slope), as this was the approximate mean length of the included studies and on chronic slope, computed from 3\u2009months after randomization 8,40.

Trial-level analyses by subgroup For the total slope, results were consistent according to CKD severity  and for the subset of participants with baseline levels of ACR greater  than 30\u2009mg\u2009g\u22121 (3.39\u2009mg\u2009mmol\u22121) (Table 2). For chronic slope, there was a small increase in the  median R2 after restricting the patients in the set of studies with ACR  available, although the BCI remained quite wide (0.65 (95% BCI 0.30,  0.88)). There was a steeper relationship between treatment effects on  the chronic slope and those of the clinical endpoint for studies with  higher baseline GFR compared to studies with lower baseline GFR. For both  the 3-year total slope and the chronic slope, for each disease group the  BCIs for the meta-regression slopes do not cross 0, and the BCIs for the  meta-regression intercepts do cross 0 (Table 2  and Fig. For total  slope, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in the meta-regression  slope, intercept or R2 across the disease subgroups.

The estimated R2 for  the CVD group is 0.47 (95% BCI 0.01\u20130.99), lower than for the other  diseases, which ranged from 0.71 (95% BCI 0.23\u20130.99) to 0.96 (95% BCI  0.23\u20131.00). Assessment of model adequacy and outliers We evaluated model adequacy and identified potential outliers by  comparing, for each study, the observed HRs for the clinical end - point to the posterior predictive distribution (PPD) for the esti - mated treatment effect on the clinical endpoint computed under  a meta-regression model fit with that study left out. For the 3-year  total slope, nine (13.6%) of 66 studies had observed HRs that fell out - side of the middle 90% intervals of the PPD; for the chronic slope,  10 (15%) of the observed HRs fell outside of the 90% intervals (Sup - plementary Table 8). Under a perfect model, it would be expected that  approximately seven studies would be outside of this range due to  chance variation; the small number of additional studies outside of this range is consistent with adequacy of the model. Prediction intervals and positive predictive value For application of these results to the use of slope as a surrogate end- point in a future trial, we applied the above meta-regression results to  compute Bayesian prediction intervals (BPIs) that provide a 95% prob - ability of including the true treatment effect on the clinical endpoint,  for varying estimated treatment effects on the slope endpoints for  hypothetical large (total sample size of 1,600), medium (total sample size of 800) and small (total sample size of 400) trials.As expected, with greater treatment benefit on GFR slope, the  estimated treatment benefit on the clinical endpoints also increases  (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 11). For example, at a treatment effect  on total GFR slope of 0.5\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2, the estimated HR on the  clinical endpoint is 0.80, whereas, for a treatment effect on GFR slope  of 1\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2, it is 0.68. The BPIs are considerably wider for the chronic slope than for the 3-year total  slope. For example, in a large future trial, the 95% BPI for the HR on  the clinical endpoint associated with an estimated treatment effect  of 0.75\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year definitively excludes an HR of 1 or  greater for the 3-year total slope (0.60\u20130.89) but not the chronic slope  (0.51\u20131.18). Similarly, the threshold for a treatment effect on the GFR  slope to assure the posterior probability of a clinical benefit, which  we defined as an HR for the clinical endpoint of less than 1, of greater  than or equal to 97.5% is substantially smaller for the 3-year total slope  than for the chronic slope (0.44\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year versus  1.26\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year). Within the different disease groups, the 95% BPI for the HR on  the clinical endpoint associated with an estimated treatment effect  of 0.75\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year is also wider for the chronic slope  than for the 3-year total slope (Extended Data Table 7). The magnitude  of the difference is smaller for the CKD (chronic slope versus 3-year  total slope (0.54\u20130.96) versus (0.57\u20130.90)) and diabetes ((0.63\u20131.13)  versus (0.59 to 0.93)) disease groups compared to that for the CVD  ((0.30\u20131.52) versus (0.61\u20130.97)) and GN ((0.34\u20131.12) versus (0.52\u20130.95))  disease groups. 2 | Trial-level analyses for the association between treatment effects on  GFR slope and treatment effects on the clinical endpoint. Circles represent separate studies, with the size of the circle proportional to the number of events (KFRT, GFR\u2009<\u200915\u2009ml\u2009min \u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 or doubling of serum creatinine). The black line is the line of regression through the studies. Trial-level analyses,  as presented here, are widely regarded as the most important criterion  for demonstrating the validity of a surrogate endpoint and are the  most difficult criterion to establish. We found that with analysis of  GFR slope using a robust method for each study, treatment effects on  the total slope computed at 3\u2009years accounted for an estimated 97%  of the variation between studies in treatment effects on the clinical  endpoint, with similar results across CKD severity and diverse disease  groups. The strength of this trial-level association falls in the range for  a strong surrogate based on one proposed classification (for example,  R2 greater than 0.72) and compares favorably with, and is arguably  stronger than, widely used surrogate endpoints in other fields, such as  progression-free survival for metastatic breast cancer or low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol for major cardiovascular events43, 44. We define  the range of treatment effects on GFR slope that have high confidence  for beneficial treatment effects on the clinical endpoint, providing  guidance on how to interpret treatment effects on GFR slope in future  RCTs. Our results indicate potential concerns with the use of the chronic  slope, which ignores the acute effect of a drug on the GFR slope\u2014an  indication that the acute reduction in GFR due to treatment initiation  might affect the clinical endpoint. Together, these data pro - vide the necessary evidence to support use of total GFR slope in RCTs  evaluating therapies of CKD progression as a valid, fit-for-purpose and  robust surrogate endpoint that can be presented to regulatory agen- cies for approval for marketing authorization, to payors to support funding of these therapies and to healthcare professionals and patients  to inform of their benefit in slowing CKD progression and preventing  kidney failure. The  earlier analyses demonstrated that treatment effects on chronic  slope accounted for a median 96% (95% BCI 63\u2013100%) of the varia - tion between studies in treatment effects on the clinical endpoint,  similar to that of the total slope in those prior analyses (97% (95% BCI  78\u2013100%)) (ref. Because the total slope includes both the acute and  chronic GFR slope, the superior performance of total slope compared  to chronic slope in the current analysis of a more diverse set of studies  suggests that the acute effect might be correlated with a component  of the primary clinical endpoint. Consistent with this hypothesis,  treatment effects on the chronic slope predicted treatment effects  on the secondary clinical endpoint, which does not include doubling  of serum creatinine, more accurately than it predicted treatment  effects on the primary clinical endpoint. We note that, although the  chronic slope exhibited weaker trial-level associations than the 3-year  total slope relative to the primary clinical endpoint, its performance  nonetheless falls within the range of R2 values (0.49\u20130.72) that has  been proposed to represent moderate performance for a surrogate  endpoint43. If there is a suspicion that a positive acute effect may not  indicate a true lasting impact on preservation of the kidney, use of the  total slope may inflate risk of falsely concluding treatment benefit39.

This finding may, in part, reflect the average negative direction  of the acute effects across the 66 RCTs included in these analyses. The acute effect has a greater impact on the computation of total  slope when the total slope is computed over shorter time intervals. For future trials, computation of total GFR slope over shorter dura- tions for interventions that do not have a negative acute effect could  be considered.The generalizability for trial-level associations for establishing  the validity of a surrogate is increased when based on a heterogeneous  set of trials, but an often-asked question is whether the overall results  can then be applied to specific subgroups. Similarly, we found that results were consistent in more severe  versus less severe kidney disease as reflected by subgroups by level  of GFR and ACR and supported by a recent publication that looked at these same questions using the more rigorous analysis of examining  interactions with the meta-regression parameters45.

Each circle represents a separate study, with the size of the circle proportional to  the number of events. The observation of weaker associations for chronic slope in the  CVD group might suggest that the less favorable results for the chronic  slope in the current analysis compared to earlier analyses may be  related to inclusion of these studies. The CVD studies were not designed  to evaluate efficacy of these interventions on CKD progression specifi - cally, and the included populations were at lower risk for progression  than those included in the other disease groups, as indicated by higher  GFR and lower ACR. First, these data provide  high confidence in the validity of the 3-year total GFR slope as a surro - gate endpoint for kidney failure, thereby allowing it to be considered  as a primary endpoint for clinical trials evaluating CKD progression  across disease subgroups and CKD severity. The strength of this  evidence is indicated in the lower limit for the 95% credible interval  for the trial-level R2 of 0.82, an increase from 0.78 in our prior results,  now substantially exceeding the threshold of 0.72 proposed for a  strong surrogate43. Although the validity of the 3-year total slope as a sur- rogate endpoint appears quite general, its practical use must consider  the circumstances of each trial. Decisions regarding the trial duration  and the use of the total slope versus chronic slope should be made in  context of the specific trial. For example, we previously demonstrated  that, compared to the clinical endpoint, use of the total slope can  substantially reduce the sample size required for adequate power  for trials without acute effects, particularly when performed in study  populations with high baseline GFR, but may require similar or larger  sample sizes in some situations, particularly for interventions with  negative acute effects46. Second, the consistency in the performance  of the total slope across CKD severity or disease suggests that the  total slope can be used to explore heterogeneous effects among sub - groups within an RCT. Similarly, GFR slope might be an appropriate  endpoint for subsequent studies after initial RCTs showed benefit  on the clinical endpoint, allowing for demonstration of treatment  benefit in different populations9,14.Strengths of this study include a large collection of RCTs with  a diverse range of disease severity, diseases and interventions. Our  application of a robust method for analysis of GFR slope that accounts  for informative censoring and multiple potential sources of variability  in GFR measurements over time allowed us to apply a uniform analysis  of GFR slope across all studies8,40. Because we analyzed individual  patient-level data, we were able to characterize agreement between  the GFR slope and clinical endpoints after adjusting for spurious cor- relations in sampling error that resulted from inclusion of the same  GFR measurements in the GFR slope and clinical endpoints41. First, we evaluated the associa - tion between the treatment effects on GFR slope and on the clinical end - points ascertained over the average follow-up period of approximately  3 years for the trials included in our analysis. Second, our calcula - tions of the prediction intervals and trial-level positive predictive  value (PPV) for a future trial assume that the relationship between the  treatment effects on the slope and clinical endpoints is similar between  the future trial and the previously conducted trials. Studies should evaluate it as  an indicator of treatment effects before widespread use in clinical trials.Table 3 | Application of GFR slope as a surrogate endpoint in a new RCT: predicted treatment effect on clinical endpoint   and PPV GFR slope Observed treatment  effect on change in GFR  slopeLarge RCT Medium RCT Small RCT Median HR and 95% BPIPPV trial Median HR and  95% BPIPPVtrial Median HR and 95% BPIPPV trial Total slope computed at  3\u2009years0.5 0.80 (0.66, 0.98) 0.98 0.80 (0.62, 1.03) 0.96 0.80 (0.58, 1.12) 0.91 0.75 0.74 (0.60, 0.89) 1.00 0.74 (0.57, 0.94) 0.99 0.74 (0.53, 1.02) 0.97 1 0.68 (0.54, 0.82) 1.00 0.68 (0.52, 0.86) 1.00 0.68 (0.48, 0.93) 0.99 Threshold for treatment effect on GFR slope  associated with 97.5% probability of clinical  benefit0.44 0.58 0.79 Chronic slope0.5 0.84 (0.55, 1.28) 0.80 0.84 (0.54, 1.32) 0.78 0.84 (0.51, 1.40) 0.75 0.75 0.78 (0.51, 1.18) 0.89 0.78 (0.49, 1.22) 0.87 0.78 (0.47, 1.29) 0.84 1 0.72 (0.47, 1.09) 0.94 0.72 (0.45, 1.12) 0.93 0.72 (0.43, 1.18) 0.91 Threshold for treatment effect on GFR slope associated with 97.5% probability of clinical  benefit1.26 1.35 1.51 Units of GFR are ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2.

Overview Our meta-analytic approach followed seven main steps: (1) search and  identify data from published RCTs using a standardized approach; (2)  obtain agreement for use of individual data and transfer to the Data  Coordinating Center at Tufts Medical Center or identify methods  for cloud-based data access; (3) within each RCT, use intent-to-treat  analyses to estimate (a) the effect of the treatment on GFR slope under  a shared-parameter mixed-effect model and (b) the effect of the treat - ment on clinical endpoint (defined as a composite of kidney failure,  sustained GFR\u2009<\u200915\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 or doubling of serum creatinine)  under a Cox proportional hazards regression model; (4) quantify the  association between treatment effects on the GFR slope and treatment  effects on clinical endpoints across RCTs using trial-level Bayesian  meta-regression analysis; (5) identify outliers and evaluate model ade- quacy across the individual trials by using a cross-validation approach  to compare the observed treatment effect on the clinical endpoint in  each trial to the PPD for that trial derived from the trial-level model fit to the remaining trials; (6) quantify the consistency in these associa-tions across disease subgroups using Bayesian meta-regression with partial pooling; and (7) assess the utility of using slope as a surrogate  endpoint in a future trial by providing 95% Bayesian prediction intervals  and trial-level PPVs corresponding with a range of possible treatment effects on the slope endpoint in a hypothetical future trial. The analytic approach is based on the causal association frame - work in which the validity of surrogate endpoints is evaluated based on  the relationship between the average causal effect of the treatment on  the surrogate endpoint and the average causal effect of the treatment  on the clinical endpoint across a population of RCTs. This approach  takes advantage of the fact that the average causal effects on the sur-rogate and clinical endpoints can be estimated with little bias within  each RCT by applying intent-to-treat analyses50\u201353. Confidence in the use  of these results for a future new trial is increased when the previously  conducted trials provide evidence that the treatment effect on the  clinical endpoint is consistently predicted from the treatment effect on  the surrogate across a broad collection of RCTs evaluating treatments  that operate through diverse mechanisms and across diverse patient  populations. As a result, the empirical support for a surrogate endpoint  is enhanced when the trial-level meta-regression is conducted over  a heterogeneous collection rather than a homogenous collection of  previously conducted RCTs. In comparison to the prior analyses, the current set of studies includes populations with higher mean levels of GFR and populations at high risk for CVD.For each study, we defined the active treatment as the treatment  hypothesized to produce the greater reduction in the risk of the clini- cal endpoint. Clinical endpoint The clinical endpoint was defined as a composite of KFRT (initiation  of chronic treatment with dialysis or kidney transplantation), a sus- tained GFR\u2009<\u200915\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 for participants with baseline  GFR\u2009\u2265\u200925\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 (herein referred to as GFR\u2009<\u200915\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121  per 1.73\u2009m2) or doubling of serum creatinine over the full study dura- tion. The exclusion of doubling of serum creatinine from the  secondary clinical endpoint assures that the remaining components  of the composite endpoint signify the occurrence or near-occurrence  of a kidney failure, considered to be the true clinical event, and reduces  the chance that that endpoint would be affected by large acute effects. Compared to the primary clinical endpoint, the secondary clinical  endpoint poses several challenges for our trial-level analyses, includ-ing: (1) treatment effects are estimated with reduced precision due to  fewer events, reducing statistical power, particularly for subgroup  analyses; (2) trial-level analyses are weighted even more heavily toward  the subgroup of trials with lower levels of baseline GFR, as KFRT and  GFR\u2009<\u200915\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 are rare events for trials with high baseline  GFR; and (3) the competing risk of death will have a greater impact. For these reasons, the composite of KFRT and GFR\u2009<\u200915\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per  1.73\u2009m2 is treated as the secondary clinical endpoint, and the broader  composite, which includes doubling of serum creatinine in addition  to these two events, is designated as the primary clinical endpoint in these analyses. Analyses of the total and chronic GFR slope (surrogate  endpoints) Changes in GFR after intervention are often nonlinear, with possi - bly differing direction and rates of change in early follow-up (herein  called acute slope) and longer-term follow-up (herein called chronic  slope). Differences  between the randomized groups in the mean GFR levels at 3-month  follow-up, the mean slopes from 3\u2009months onward and the estimated  mean changes from baseline to either 2-year or 3-year follow-up fac - tored by the follow-up duration represented the treatment effects on  the acute, chronic and total slopes, respectively. Our primary analyses Nature Medicine Analysis https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02418-0focused on the total GFR slope computed at 3\u2009years (herein called 3-year  total slope), the approximate mean length of the included studies and  on the chronic slope. A power of the mean (POM) model for the  residual variance is used to allow for greater variation in individual GFR  measurements at higher GFR. The model allows for non-uniform treat - ment effects in which treatments slow progression by a greater extent  among patients with faster GFR decline than for patients with slower  GFR decline by allowing different between-patient slope variances  in the treatment and control groups8,40. In studies in which at least 15  individuals died or reached KFRT, the model accounts for informative  censoring by these events by incorporating the mixed model for the  GFR measurements within a shared-parameter model in which the risk  of KFRT or death was assumed to be related to the random slopes and  intercepts of the GFR part of the model62,63. As described above, we applied the mixed-effects models to estimate the treatment effects on GFR slope  within each study by treatment arm, with treatment effects expressed  as differences in the mean GFR slopes between the treatment versus  control groups in units of ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year. We next applied a trial-level Bayesian  mixed-effects meta-regression model to relate the treatment effects  on the clinical endpoint to the treatment effects on GFR slope with  study as the unit of analysis41,50. The model relates the treatment effects  on the two endpoints after accounting for the standard errors in the  estimated effects in each study and the correlation of these errors  with each other. This approach takes advantage of the fact that the  average causal effects on the surrogate and clinical endpoints can be  estimated with little bias within each randomized trial by applying  intent-to-treat analyses51\u201353. The model includes two stages, where the  first stage relates the estimated treatment effects to the true latent  treatment effects within each trial and the second stage describes  the relationships between the true latent treatment effects across the  different trials. For simplicity,  as most trials included a single treatment comparison, we abuse the  notation slightly and write that the index i refers to the ith trial. We let  \u03b8i and \u03b3i denote the true latent treatment effects on the clinical endpoint  and on the GFR slope in the i th trial and use \u0302\u03b8i and \u0302\u03b3i to indicate the  estimated effects obtained as described above. The first stage of   the model relates the estimated and true latent treatment effects in  the ith trial by: [\u0302\u03b8i \u0302\u03b3i]\u223cMVN([\u03b8i \u03b3i],[\u03c32 iri\u03c3i\u03b4i ri\u03c3i\u03b4i\u03b42 i]) Here, \u03c3i is the standard error of the estimated treatment effect on  the clinical endpoint; \u03b4i is the standard error of the estimated treatment effect on GFR slope in the i th trial; and ri is the correlation between these  estimated treatment effects. For two trials that included  two different comparisons of active treatments to control, we also  accounted for the correlations between the two treatment contrasts  with the same control group. The notation MVN() indicates that the  estimated treatment effects are assumed to follow a bivariate normal  distribution given the true treatment effects within each trial; this  assumption is satisfied to a high degree of accuracy due to the central limit theorem. The second stage of the model characterizes the variation in the  true latent treatment effects on GFR slope and on the clinical endpoint  across the trials. This second stage is expressed as [\u03b8i \u03b3i]\u223cN([\u03bc\u03b8 \u03bc\u03b3],[\u03c32 \u03b8R\u03c3\u03b8\u03c3\u03b3 R\u03c3\u03b8\u03c3\u03b3\u03c32 \u03b3]) where \u03bc\u03b8 and \u03bc\u03b3 are, respectively, the means of the true latent treatment  effects on the clinical endpoint and on GFR slope in the population of  trials represented by this meta-regression; \u03c3\u03b8 and \u03c3\u03b3 are the standard  deviations of the true latent treatment effects across the population of trials; and R is the correlation between the true latent treatment effects  on the two endpoints. Based on this two-stage model, the slope and  intercept of the meta-regression line predicting the true latent treatment  effect on the clinical endpoint from the true latent treatment effect on  the surrogate endpoint are given by \u03b2\u2009=\u2009R\u03c3\u03b8/\u03c3\u03b3 and \u03b1\u2009=\u2009\u03bc\u03b8\u2009\u2212\u2009\u03b2\u03bc\u03b3, respec - tively, and the residual standard deviation or RMSE, which defines the  uncertainty in the treatment effect on the clinical endpoint given a par- ticular treatment effect on the surrogate endpoint, is RMSE = \u03c3\u03b8\u00d7(1\u2212R2)1 2. The two-stage model was fit using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov  chain sampling, using diffuse prior distributions for the model param - eters that we selected so that the final results would depend primarily  on the data with little influence of the prior distributions. The prior  on the meta-regression slope was uniform with a range of \u22125 to 5. The priors for the mean treatment effects on the clinical endpoint  (expressed as a log HR) and on each GFR slope endpoint (expressed as  difference between treatment arms in ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year)  were taken to be normal distributions each with mean 0 and variance  10,000; the priors for the variances of the treatment effects on the  clinical endpoint and on the GFR slope endpoints were each taken to  be inverse gamma distributions with shape parameter 0.261. The scale  parameter was 0.000408 for the clinical endpoint and 0.005 for the  slope endpoints. The prior distribution for the clinical endpoint was  selected by the investigators to assign 1/3 prior probabilities each to  low treatment effect heterogeneity (which we defined as a treatment effect standard deviation on the log-scale \u22640.05), medium treatment  effect heterogeneity (defined as a treatment effect standard deviation  on the log-scale between 0.05 and 0.20) and high treatment effect  heterogeneity (defined as a treatment effect standard deviation on  the log-scale >0.20). For slope, the prior assigns a 1/3 prior probability  to slope standard deviations\u2009\u2264\u20090.175\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year, 1/3  to a slope standard deviation between 0.175\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per  year and 0.70\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year and 1/3 to a slope standard  deviation\u2009>\u20090.70\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year. We checked that the  prior distributions had only a small influence on the results by verifying  that the results of each analysis were similar under alternative inverse  gamma (0.001, 0.001) prior distributions for the variances for the  treatment effects on the clinical endpoint and on GFR slope. The meta-regression supports the validity of GFR slope  as a surrogate endpoint if (1) the slope of the meta-regression line has a large magnitude with a BCI that does not cross 0; (2) the intercept is  close to 0 and with a BCI that crosses 0, implying absence of a substan - tial average effect on the clinical endpoint when the treatment does Nature Medicine Analysis https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02418-0not affect GFR slope; and (3) the R2 of the meta-regression is large,  indicating strong associations (for example, >0.72) (ref. 43 ), so that  treatment effects on GFR slope account for most of the variation in  treatment effects on the clinical endpoint. The meta-regression slope provides the mean difference in the log  HR for the clinical endpoint associated with each 1\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2  per year increment in the treatment effect on the GFR slope endpoint. The meta-regression intercepts provide the estimated mean log HR  for the clinical endpoint when the mean treatment effect on the GFR  slope endpoint is equal to 0. To assist with interpretation, we express  the impact under the meta-regression model of a 0.75\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per  1.73\u2009m2 difference in the treatment effect on GFR slope on the HR for  the treatment effect on the clinical endpoint using the formula: %DifferenceinHRforclinicalendpoint =100\u00d7(1\u2212exp(0.75 \u00d7(meta\u2212regressionslope ))) For example, a 0.75\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year greater beneficial  effect of the treatment on the 3-year total GFR slope is associated with  an average 23%\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u00d7\u2009(1\u2009\u2212\u2009exp(0.75\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u22120.35)) lower HR for the clinical  endpoint. We wanted to evaluate whether the strength of the associations differed for studies with higher versus lower levels of GFR. Urine albumin higher than 30\u2009mg\u2009g\u22121 (3.39\u2009mg\u2009mmol\u22121) is the  threshold for diagnosis of CKD, regardless of the level of GFR. This approach adds a third stage to the basic two-stage mixed-effects meta-regression model described for the analysis of the full cohort of 66 stud-ies described above. In the extended partial-pooling model, the first stage again describes the relationship between the estimated treatment effects and the true latent treatment effects on the slope and clinical endpoints within each trial. The second stage includes separate meta-regressions that describe the relationship between the true latent treatment effects on the slope and clinical endpoints across the studies within each of the designated subgroups of trials. The third stage describes the variation in the meta-regression terms of the second stage between the designated subgroups. When the data suggest a small amount of variation in a particular meta-regression term (such as the meta-regression slope or intercept) between the subgroups, then the subgroup-specific posterior distributions for that term will be more distinct between subgroups due to a lesser degree of information sharing. Alternatively, if the data do not suggest a large degree of heterogeneity in any given term across subgroups, then there will be more information sharing across subgroups, and the posterior distributions for that term will be more similar. For each study, we pro - duced a PPD for the estimated treatment effect on the clinical endpoint  based on the estimated treatment effect on GFR slope in that study and  the meta-regression model fit to the remaining trials with that study  held out. The PPD takes into account uncertainty in the meta-regression  parameter estimates as well as the sampling error of the estimated  treatment effects within the held-out trial. We graphically displayed the  actual observed effect on the clinical endpoint to an interval extending  from the 5th to the 95th percentile of the PPD for each trial, to display  how well the trial-level model predicts the treatment effect in a \u2018new  trial\u2019 based on a model developed from the remaining trials. We defined  potential outliers as trials where the observed effects fell in the top 5%  or the bottom 5% of the PPD, recognizing that, on average, 10% of tri-als would be flagged as outliers by chance under a perfect model. We computed  posterior medians and 95% credible intervals for the meta-regression intercept, slope, RMSE and R 2 to identify whether, after an individual  trial was removed, the interpretation of results meaningfully changed. We obtained 95% prediction  intervals for the treatment effect on the clinical endpoint given a par- ticular value for the true latent treatment effect on GFR slope by simu- lating the posterior distribution of \u03b1  + \u03b2  \u00d7 True.Effslope  + \u03940, where True. Effslope  is the true latent treatment effect on the GFR slope endpoint;   \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u00d7 True.Effslope  represents the predicted mean true latent treatment  effect on the clinical endpoint based on the meta-regression model;  and \u03940 is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation  given by the RMSE from the meta-regression. Here, \u03940 represents the  variation in the true latent treatment effects on the clinical endpoint  across different trials with the same treatment effect on GFR slope. This prediction interval accounts for uncertainty in the estimation  of \u03b1 and \u03b2  and in the RMSE that defines the meta-regression, as well  as uncertainty due to variation in the treatment effects on the clinical endpoint about the regression line for different trials. When the trial-level meta-regression is applied to a newly con - ducted randomized trial, there is an additional source of uncertainty  that results from imprecision in the estimation of the treatment effect  on GFR slope in the new trial. This added uncertainty depends on the  sample size and is smaller when the sample size for the new trial is large. We obtained 95% prediction intervals for the true latent treatment  effect on the clinical endpoint in a new trial that take into account this additional uncertainty by again sampling from the posterior distribu- tion of \u03b1  + \u03b2  \u00d7 True.Effslope  + \u03940, but now assume that True.Effslope  has a  random distribution to reflect the uncertainty in its estimation in the  new trial instead of taking True.Effslope  to be a fixed value. Specifically, we  assumed that the posterior distribution of True.Effslope  is normally dis- tributed with mean equal to the estimated treatment effect on GFR slope  and standard deviation given by the standard error for the estimated  treatment effect on GFR slope based on the sample size. We  performed this calculation for a trial with a between-patient standard  deviation in chronic GFR slopes of 4.0\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year, with  residual GFR variance equal to 0.67 \u00d7 (mean baseline GFR), where the mean baseline GFR is 40\u2009ml\u2009min \u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2. We used a similar sampling approach for the posterior distribution  of \u03b1 + \u03b2  \u00d7 True.Effslope  + \u03940 to estimate the probability that the treatment  effect of the clinical endpoint in the new trial, expressed as a log HR,  would fall below 0 (corresponding to a non-zero treatment benefit  with an HR for the clinical endpoint less than 1) given either the true  or the estimated treatment effects on GFR slope in the new trial. We  refer to the probability of a clinical benefit in the new trial associated  with a particular treatment effect on GFR slope as the trial-level PPV,  which we denoted by PPVtrial. By considering the PPV as a function of  the estimated treatment effect on GFR slope, we determined the size of the smallest treatment effect on GFR slope that would be required to assure a PPV of at least 0.975 for a benefit on the clinical endpoint. Most of the 66 participating studies included sample size calculations that  are described in the protocols of the respective studies. We used a pre - defined protocol to identify studies for inclusion in the analyses of this  report using systematic review of the literature with predefined inclu - sion and exclusion criteria (Study Protocol and Extended Data Fig. Because  our analyses were applied to all available studies that met the entry  criteria, we did not perform sample size calculations for the number of studies to be included in the trial-level analyses.

Methods We investigated the cross-sectional association between measured GFR, age, and health in persons aged 50 \u201397 years in the general population through a meta-analysis of iohexol clearance mea- surements in three large European population-based cohorts. The mean GFR was lower in older age by 20.72 ml/min per 1.73 m 2per year (95% con\ufb01dence interval [95% CI], 20.96 to 20.48) for men who were healthy versus 21.03 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year (95% CI, 21.25 to 20.80) for men who were unhealthy, and by 20.92 ml/min per 1.73 m2per year (95% CI, 21.14 to 20.70) for women who were healthy versus 21.22 ml/min per 1.73 m2per year (95% CI, 21.43 to 21.02) for women who were unhealthy. For healthy and unhealthy people of both sexes, both the 97.5th and 2.5th GFR percentiles exhibited a negative linear association with age. However, both the mean and 97.5 percentiles of the GFR distribution are lower in older persons whoare healthy than in middle-aged persons who are healthy.

Although there are some large population- based studies based on GFR estimated from serum creati- nine, 8\u201315this approach is problematic in older people because of confounding by sarcopenia and other non-GFR \u2013related factors.16\u201320 We performed a meta-analysis of individual participant data from four population-based studies in three Europeancohorts where GFR had been measured using plasma iohexolclearance in persons aged between 50 and 97 years. Our aims were to study the association of GFR with age in healthy people and predict reference intervals for GFR in healthy aging acrosst h es t u d i e da g er a n g e .B e c a u s ei tw o u l dn o tb ep o s s i b l et operform a population-based study with a high number of trulyhealthy individuals in the oldest age groups, we designed thestudy to use a generalized additive regression model to adjustfor the association of comorbidity and risk factors with GFRand to predict the distribution of GFR in hypothetically healthy persons. Three eligiblecohorts were identi \ufb01ed: the Renal Iohexol Clearance Survey (RENIS) in Troms\u00f8 6 (RENIS-T6; n51632); 21the Berlin Ini- tiative Study (BIS; n5610);22and the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility \u2013Kidney Study (AGES-Kidney; n5819) (Figure 1).23 The RENIS cohort included a repeated GFR measurement in the RENIS follow-up study (RENIS-FU) after a mean follow- up of 5.6 years ( n51329).24The examinations in RENIS-T6 and RENIS-FU were both included in this investigation. The RENIS cohort included participants between 50 and 63 years of age at baseline from the sixth wave of a series ofpopulation surveys in the municipality of Troms\u00f8 in northernNorway. AGES-Kidney is a substudy of the AGES-II-Reykjavik Study, which was a follow-up of the population-based Reykjavik Study in Iceland.23T h er e s p o n s er a t ei nt h eA G E S - I I - R e y k j a v i kS t u d yw a s 71%,26and for those eligible for AGES-Kidney the response rate was 65%.23 The inclusion criteria for the three cohorts were similar, except AGES-Kidney excluded individuals receiving active cancer treatment, and BIS excluded persons that requirednursing care during daytime and nighttime. The people invited to AGES-Kidney and RENIS comprised random samples of the general population, and those invited to BIS comprised a random sample from the Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse Nordost , which provides insurance cover- age to almost 50% of people older than 70 years in Berlin.22 Although participation was voluntary, the three cohorts ofexamined persons were all representative of their source pop-ulations. 27The mean eGFR, calculated using the Modi- \ufb01cation of Diet in Renal Disease equation, was 89.3 versus 90.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2for women, and 93.1 versus 93.2 ml/min per 1.73 m2for men in RENIS and the Troms\u00f8 Study, respectively. The prevalence of the most important chronic diseases in BIS was similar to that of all persons older than 70 years in the Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse Nordost .28Also, the prevalence of diabetes,29myocardial infarction,30angina pectoris,30 stroke,31and cancer32were of a similar order of magnitude as in other German studies of chronic diseases in older adults. The participants in AGES-Kidney were younger, had lower systolic BP, and were less likely to be current smokers or have cardiovascular disease or diabetes than participants in AGES-II-Reykjavik who were not included.23The meanSigni \ufb01cance Statement In populations, mean GFR is lower in older age, but whether healthy aging is associated with preserved rather than lower GFR in some individuals is unknown. In a meta-analysis of three large European- based cohorts, the authors investigated the cross-sectional asso-ciation of being healthy (de \ufb01ned as having no major chronic disease or risk factors for CKD), age, and iohexol clearance measurements. The mean and the 97.5th percentile of the GFR distribution were higher in older persons who were healthy than in those who wereunhealthy, but lower than in middle-aged people who were healthy.The GFR-age association was more negative in women than in men. 21\u201324 Technically unsuccessful measurements were excluded from the investigations (RENIS-T6, n55; RENIS-FU, n55; AGES-Kidney, n514; BIS, n540; Figure 1).21,23,24,33 This study was approved by the ethical review boards of the three respective investigations, and the study was approved bythe Icelandic National Bioethics Committee (VSN 00-063).

The dashed arrow from RENIS-T6 to RENIS-FU indicates the repeated measurements of GFR in the RENIS cohort after a mean follow-up of 5.6 years. Details about urinary creatinine and albumin measure- ments in all three cohorts have been given previously.23,28,34 The urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) was classi \ufb01ed in the categories ,10,$10 and,30, and $30 mg/g, corre- sponding to the categories optimal, high normal, andhigh/very high/nephrotic. 35 In RENIS and AGES-Kidney, BP was measured as described previously.23,36 BP in BIS was measured according to the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hyper-tension (ESC/ESH) recommendations. 38The iohexol assays of the three studies were calibrated by reanalyzing thawed samples in the laboratory of the Department of Medical Biochemis- try, University Hospital of North Norway (UNN; Troms\u00f8,Norway). 38No calibration was found to be necessary for the BIS and RENIS samples, but the following equation was usedto calibrate the AGES-Kidney results to the UNN laboratory:log(iohexol UNN)520.09111.0253log(iohexol AGES).38This calibration resulted in a mean difference in GFR of only 0.87 ml/min from the original results. 33,36,40 eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine(eGFRcrea) using the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation.41 Statistical Analyses Characteristics of the study participants were provided at thetime of the GFR measurements, i.e., characteristics for the RENIS cohort was reported for both the baseline (RENIS-T6) and the follow-up (RENIS-FU) examination. 42The associations between GFR indexed for body surface area andage, sex, health status, and cohort membership were exploredin generalized additive regression models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) using the gamV procedure from the mgcViz-package in R. 43,44 GAMLSS is a new regression method suitable for modeling the age-dependent distribution of variables. A detailed explanation of the method can befound in the Supplemental M ethods (Supplemental Figure 1, Supplemental References). In brief, the mean andSD of the GFR distribution are modeled as separate functionsof the independent variables in the same regression model. In addition to investigating the association of the independent variableswith the mean of the GFR distribution as in ordinary regres-sion methods, GAMLSS makes it possible to investigate theirassociation with the SD of the distribution. We analyzed the associations between GFR indexed for body surface area as the dependent variable and age, sex,and health status as independent variables. We adjusted forthe correlation between the \ufb01rst (RENIS-T6) and second (RENIS-FU) GFR measurement for the same individual inthe RENIS cohort by including a random intercept for eachparticipant in all models. The GFR-age associ-ation was de \ufb01ned as the difference in mean GFR per 1-year older age and is represented by the coef \ufb01cient for the age vari- able in the regression model. The re- gression coef \ufb01cient for the interaction between age and health status represents the association between health status and theGFR-age association. 45This criterion scores the models for \ufb01t to the data, but penalizes the score for the number of independent variables and complexity of the model. We\ufb01rst analyzed both the mean and the SD of the GFR distribution as functions of the main effects of age, sex, and thehealth status variable. We also included the interaction be-tween age and health status and a random sex-speci \ufb01c effect for cohort membership to adjust for possible differences inGFR distribution between the cohorts. In this model, statistically signi \ufb01cant main effects of all of the independent variables and the age-health status interac-tion were found for the mean of GFR ( P,0.05). Accordingly, in the SD part of the model, the sex-speci \ufb01c cohort random effect was removed and a common cohort random effect for both sexes ( P,0.05) was retained. To investigate the possibility of different associations be- tween age and GFR distributions across the cohorts, we in-cluded random effects for the interaction between age andcohort in the functions for both the mean and the SD ofGFR. This means that the GFR-age associations may differ between the cohorts, and adding this effect to the func-tion for the mean of the model improved the \ufb01t (AIC533306.61). Next, we tested interactions between age and sex, and health status and sex, for both the mean and SD in this model.Only the interaction between age and sex for the mean wasstatistically signi \ufb01cant ( P50.005). Possible nonlinear effects of age were tested by adding smooth terms for the interaction between age and health sta-tus, and age and sex in separate models. This was done for boththe mean and SD of GFR, but model \ufb01t was no better for these models than for the model without nonlinear terms(AIC533302.98 for the interaction between age and healthstatus; AIC 533304.35 for age and sex). In a separate model, we also tested the effect of the three-way interaction betweenage, sex, and health status on the GFR mean, which was notstatistically signi \ufb01cant ( P50.34). The random cohort effects in the model were set to zero inthese predictions, which means that the predictions representan average between the three cohorts. RENIS-T6 and RENIS-FU combined covered theage range 50 \u201370 years, and the age ranges for BIS and AGES- Kidney were 70 \u201397 and 74 \u201393 years, respectively. The dif- ferences between the cohorts shown in Table 1 re \ufb02ect the variation in age and in inclusion criteria.

A scatterplot of all of the GFR measurements versus age according to health status is presented in Figure 2. Table 2 shows the observed median and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles for GFR according to the health statusvariable for each of the cohorts. Using GAMLSS regression, we analyzed the mean and the SD of the GFR distribution as functions of age, sex, cohort,and the health status variable (Table 3, Supplemental Table 3).The intercept of the model corresponds to the GFR estimatefor a 50-year-old woman who is unhealthy (Table 3). Beinghealthy was associated with a slightly lower mean GFR of3.25 ml/min per 1.73 m 2at age 50 years, but with a markedly higher GFR-age association of 0.30 ml/min per 1.73 m2per year, 1606 JASN JASN 31:1602 \u20131615, 2020CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY www.jasn.org Downloaded from http://journals.lww.com/jasn by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hCywCX1AW nYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC1y0abggQZXdtwnfKZBYtws= on 04/25/2025as represented by the coef \ufb01cient for the interaction between age and health status in Table 3 ( P,0.001).

The difference in GFR-age association betweenmen and women was also observed when we strati \ufb01ed by age younger or older than 70 years (Supplemental Figure 2) and by cohort, although this was not statistically signi \ufb01cant (0.12, 0.12, and 0.16 ml/min per 1.73 m 2per year in RENIS, AGES-Kidney, and BIS, respectively).Table 1.

Thism e a n st h a ta l t h o u g hm e a nG F Rw a sl o w e ra th i g h e ra g e ,t h evariation in GFR at any given age for a given health status wasmore or less the same. The random effects in the model demonstrate there were differences between the cohorts with regard to the associationbetween GFR and male sex ( P50.003), in the GFR-age asso- ciation ( P50.03), and in the SD of the GFR distribution (P,0.001) (Supplemental Table 3). Because we had only three different cohorts, which may be considered few for the esti- mation of random effects, we replaced the random cohort effects with \ufb01xed effects and reanalyzed the model. The point estimates of the \ufb01xed effects model were very similar to the random effects model (Supplemental Table 4). We repeated the analyses of the model shown in Table 3 with nonindexed GFR, measured in ml/min, as the dependentvariable and height and weight added as independent vari-ables. The effect of being healthy on the GFR-age association was very similar to that in the primary analysis (0.32 [95% CI, 0.20 to 0.45] versus 0.30 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.43] ml/min per1.73 m 2per year; Table 3). The 95% CI for the GFR-age association for persons whowere healthy was consistently lower than zero in all of thesubgroups. The predicted median and 95% reference intervals for GFR in a healthy person based on the \ufb01nal GAMLSS model (Table 3) have been plotted against age for men and women inFigure 3. In people who were healthy, the 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2threshold intersects the 2.5th percentile at age 67.1 years for women and 70.8 years for men (Figure 3). Table 4presents predicted median GFR values and 95% referenceranges for 5-year intervals in healthy men and women.Predicted tenth, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of theGFR distribution can be found in Supplemental Table 5. Measurements for both the baseline (RENIS-T6) and the follow-up examinations (RENIS-FU) of the same persons in the RENIS cohort are shown. In potential living kidney donors, point estimates between20.5 and 20.9 ml/min per 1.73 m 2per year have been found.51\u201353,56 \u201358 If adjustment for health status had eliminated the GFR-age association, this would have supported the hypothesis thatpoor health fully accounts for the \ufb01nding of lower mean GFR in old age. 5It is noteworthy that the SD of GFR did not increase with age in persons who were healthy, as would be expected if a subset of this group had unrecognized kidneydisease, whereas others aged with preserved GFR. If even aminority of exceptionally healthy individuals aged with pre-served rather than lower GFR, one would expect no or only aweak age association for the 97.5th percentile of the GFR dis-tribution. Although the absence of these \ufb01ndings in this study does not refute the hypothesis, it suggests that age or other factors may contribute to the association. A similar \ufb01nding regarding the 95th percentile was observed in a study of po-tential living kidney donors by Chakkera et al. 59The results a r ea l s oc o n s i s t e n tw i t hh i s t o l o g i c \ufb01ndings in biopsies from living kidney donors, which indicate that nephron number islower at older age even in people who are apparently healthy,although the study by Denic et al. 6only included persons younger than 75 years and may not be representative of older healthy people in the general population. The observation of a high proportion of persons with non- declining GFR in some longitudinal studies may be explainedby a failure to use statistical methods that take measurementerror into account. 8,10,12,60 \u201362This will overestimate the var- iability of the rate at which GFR declines and the proportion ofpersons with nondeclining GFR. Also, none of these studiesused precise methods to measure GFR, 8\u201315,60 \u201366and, exceptfor one small Swedish study,67they were not population based.60,61,63 \u201366The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging is often referred to as having found that a third of a group ofpersons who were healthy experienced no decline in GFR. However, the study may have been biased by the use of creat- inine clearance for assessing GFR and the inclusion of patientswith diabetes in the healthy group. 60 Being unhealthy was associated with a slightly higher GFR in the regression model (Table 3), which indicates that meanGFR for persons who were unhealthy was higher thanfor those who were healthy among the youngest participants(Figure 3). Previous population-based studies,9,12 small studies using measured GFR,51,52,54,75 \u201377and studies of persons with established CKD62,78 \u201381have yielded mixed results about sex differences in GFR-age associations, but mostof them did not fully adjust for comorbidity and risk factors.Our\ufb01ndings may partly explain the higher prevalence of CKD in women than in men, but do not explain why more men thanwomen initiate RRT.

One study of CKD prevalence found that Norway had the lowest and Northeastern Germany the high-est prevalence, 83and that these differences could not be ex- plained by variations in hypertension, diabetes, or obesity. One method for de \ufb01ning reference intervals for physiologic or biochemical parameters is to take the 95th interpercentilerange of their distribution in a population of persons who arehealthy. 7Accordingly, most previous studies of reference intervals for GFR have in- cluded few individuals older than 70 years and have made no distinction between healthy subjects and others.53,84 \u201386By con- trast, we used a statistical model to estimate the effects of diseaseand risk factors and to predict percentiles of GFR in personswho were healthy and between age 50 and 95 years. Because weadjusted for the heterogeneity between the cohorts, the predic-tions represent an average of the observations in three differentgeographic regions.A comparison between classi \ufb01cation of low GFR based on the 2.5th percentile for persons who are healthy in thisstudy and the currently accepted criterion for CKD stage 3\u20135( G F R ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) shows that the criterion underestimates the prevalence of low GFR in women youn-ger than 67.1 years and in men younger than 70.8 years, andoverestimates the prevalence at higher ages (Figure 3).However, this is the result of applying a low percentile andar a t h e rs t r i c td e \ufb01nition of \u201chealthy \u201dto assess the effect of age on GFR under optimal physiologic conditions. In addi-tion to reference intervals for GFR in people who are healthy, an optimal classi \ufb01cation system for CKD should be based on the risk of adverse outcomes at different levelsof GFR. Predicted medians (bold lines) and 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles (dashed lines) of iohexol clearance (black) and eGFR based on creatinine (red) as functions of age for healthy women (upperpanel) and men (lower panel). The principal strength of this study is that we used mea- sured GFR instead of eGFR and that the cohorts are popula- tion based. The number of included persons far exceeds that of pre-vious studies using measured GFR, especially in the oldest agegroups. Although the low number of persons who werehealthy in the highest age groups may have limited the powerof statistical tests for the interaction between age, health status, and other variables, it seems unlikely that we have failed to include a signi \ufb01cant number of very old persons who were healthy with preserved GFR that would have changed ourconclusion. The heterogeneity between the three cohorts is a reason for caution in applying the results to other populations. We can- not exclude a survivor bias in the estimates of the GFR distri-bution, especially in the older age groups. Due to the cross-sectionaldesign of our study, the GFR-age associations apply at thepopulation level, whereas the rates of change at the individuallevel could not be estimated. 88However, even allowing for great variation and possible nonlinear individual GFR trajectories, the \ufb01nding that the 2.5th percentile in 50-year-old people who are healthy is sim-ilar to the 97.5th percentile in 95-year-old people who arehealthy (Figure 3) suggests that aging with preserved GFRacross this age span must be very uncommon. We conclude that there is a negative linear GFR-age asso- ciation in people who are healthy and aged between 50 and 95 years, and an even more negative association for peoplewith chronic diseases and CKD risk factors.

Statist. Definition of Q In a meta-analysis of kstudies, the basic ingredients for Qare the studies\u2019 estimates of the effect and the estimated standard errors of those estimates. In the notation of Cochran [1], the effect estimate fromStudy iisx i,andthecorrespondingestimatedstandarderroris si(i=1,\u2026,k).Qmeasuresheterogeneity of the xiby summarizing their variation around a weighted mean, \u0304xw, in which the weight for xiis the reciprocal ofits estimated variance, wi=1\u2215s2 i: \u0304xw=\u2211k i=1wixi/\u2211k i=1wi. Often, Qserves as the basis for a formal test of homogeneity, in which (under the null hypothesis) Qis assumed to follow a chi-squared distribution with k\u22121 degrees of freedom. Under the heading \u2018Mistakes to avoid when selecting a model\u2019, Borenstein et al.[2]comment,\u2018Thisisabadideaformanyreasons.\u2019Theydiscussfourreasonsandthen emphasizethepointintheirsummary:\u2018Thestrategyofstartingwithafixed-effectmodelandthenmovingto a random-effects model if the test for heterogeneity is significant relies on a flawed logic and shouldbe strongly discouraged\u2019. In the context of a high-profile example, a meta-analysis of the incidence ofmyocardialinfarctionandcardiacdeathinrandomizedtrialsinvolvingthedrugrosiglitazone[3],Shusteret al. [4] demonstrate that that strategy can lead to potentially misleading results. Cochran\u2019s1954 paper For an understanding of Q, it is helpful to examine the setting in William Cochran\u2019s 1954 paper, \u2018The Combination of Estimates from Different Experiments\u2019 [1]: \u2018This paper discusses one of the simpleraspects of the problem, in which there is sufficient uniformity of experimental methods so that the ith experiment provides an estimate x iof\ud835\udf07and an estimate siof the standard error of xi. The experiments may be, for example, determinations of a physical or astronomical constant by different scientists, orbioassayscarriedoutindifferentlaboratories,oragriculturalfieldexperimentslaidoutindifferentpartsofaregion.Thequantity x imaybeasimplemeanoftheobservations,asinaphysicaldetermination,or the difference between the means of two treatments, as in a comparative experiment, or a median lethaldose,oraregressioncoefficient.\u2019If\u2018thevaluesofthe x iagreeamongthemselveswithinthelimitsoftheir experimental errors\u2019,Cochran postulates \u2018anunderlying mathematical model of theform xi=\ud835\udf07+ei, where eiis the experimental error of xi. If the values of the xidiffer by more than can be accounted for bytheir experimental errors,werequirea model of theform xi=\ud835\udf07i+ei, where\ud835\udf07i, which might be called the \u201ctrue value\u201d in the ith experiment, varies from one experiment to another.\u2019Ifsuchvariationexists,Cochranreferstoitas\u2018an interaction [italicsoriginal]oftheeffectwith experiments\u2019. Cochran makes clear that the process is not a mechanical one (page 102): \u2018If an interaction exists, the type of combined estimate that is wanted requires careful consideration. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License D.C.HOAGLIN account the purpose for which the combined estimate is to be made and the reasons for the presence of interaction,insofarasthesecanbediscovered. [illustrationsofinteractionsomitted]thecombinationofthe individual estimates is not a routine matter, but requires clear thinking about both the nature of the data and the function of the combined estimate. However, unless it is decided that no type of combined estimatewillserveausefulpurpose,wedofacetheproblemofcombiningatleastovercertainsubgroupsofthe experiments.\u2019 Considering the difference in setting and the passage of time, Cochran\u2019s advice differs little from that given by, for example, Borenstein et al. [2]. Theconservativedecision,whenindoubt,istoassumeinteractionspresent,sincethetechniquesforthissituationremain valid even ifinteractions are absent.\u2019 Throughout the paper, Cochran associates with each estimated variance, s 2 i, a number of degrees of freedom, ni. Thus, the niare an inherent part of the definition of Q. For the sorts of xithat Cochran discusses, the degrees of freedom ordinarily come from a mean square (e.g., the sample variance or the residual mean square of a regression). The development in Cochran\u2019s paper has implications for the distribution of Q, the standard error of \u0304xw, estimationofthe variance of the \ud835\udf07i, and potential bias in \u0304xw. Cochran defines Qas in Section 2 and then comments (page 114): \u2018If the degrees of freedom niare large, Qfollows the \ud835\udf122distribution with ( k\u22121) degrees of freedom.\u2019 (Today one might write\u2018approaches\u2019insteadof\u2018follows\u2019.Itislikelythat,in1954,readersinterpreted\u2018follows\u2019inthatway.) Because nis the number of degrees of freedom for each of the s2 i, however, this approximation is unlikely to be useful for meta- analysis. (\u0304xw)=\u221a 1 w{ 1+4 w2\u22111 n\u2032 iwi(w\u2212wi)} , where w=\u03a3wiandn\u2032 i=ni\u22124(k\u22122)\u2215(k\u22121).\u2018Theterminsidethebracketsisanadjustmentwhichtakes accountofsamplingerrorsintheweights1/s2 iasestimatesofthetrueweights1/\ud835\udf0e2 i,andalsoofthefact that the principal term inside the square root, 1 \u2215w, tends to be an underestimate of the corresponding population expression. For the approximate number of degrees of freedom neto beattached tothis standarderror,Meier (1953) [8]suggests ne=w2 \u2211(w2 i/ni).\u2019 Themeta-analysisliterature,however, generally uses1/ wtoestimatethe variance of \u0304xw. Estimation of the variance of the \ud835\udf07i. When interactions are present (corresponding to random-effects meta-analysis), Cochran does not use Qas the basis for an estimate of the variance of the \ud835\udf07i.

(Even for the mean of Q, the expansion is sufficiently complicatedthatIdonotquoteithere. )Asanexample,theyapplytheirexpansionstotheriskdifference.On the basis of extensive simulations, they recommend approximating the null distribution of Qby a gammadistributionwhosefirsttwomomentsequaltheestimatesderivedfromtheexpansions.Theyfindthat the resulting test for homogeneity is substantially more accurate than the usual chi-squared test and other tests,especially when thestudies\u2019samplesizes aresmall or moderate.

Inanotherpaperwhosetitleincludes\u2018theexactdistributionofCochran\u2019s Q\u2019,PreussandZiegler[16]build onthe\u2018exact\u2019cumulativedistributionfunctionofCochran\u2019s QderivedbyBiggerstaffandJacksonanduse partial integration to avoid evaluating that CDF numerically in order to obtain a confidence interval for thebetween-studyvariance inrandom-effectsmeta-analysis.PreussandZiegler(page56)say,\u2018Inthesederivations, we have made the conventional assumption that the within study variances are known. If, for example, the measure of effect size is the log of the odds ratio, they can (for each replication) calculate the study-specificestimates and their estimated variances, as the definition of Qrequires. Almostallsucheffortsreportedintheliterature,however,assumethateachstudy-specificestimatehasanormaldistributionandthatthevariancesofthoseestimatesareknown.Thus,theyforgoanopportunitytoexaminetheactualnullandnon-nulldistributionsof Qinvarioussettings.Forexample,Mittlb\u00f6ckand Heinzl [17] assume that each study-specific estimate has a normal distribution; \u2018make the conventionalassumption that the precisions are known, although in reality they are estimated from the data in eachstudy\u2019;andsaythat\u2018[u]nderthenullhypothesisofhomogeneity,thestatistic Qfollowsa \ud835\udf12 2-distribution withdfdegreesoffreedom, df=k\u22121\u2019.Simulationswithsuchlimitingassumptionsareunlikelytohave much relevance to actual meta-analyses. On the other hand, in a study of confidence intervals (based on Qand other approaches) for the amount of heterogeneity in random-effects meta-analysis, with log-odds-ratio as the measure of effectsize,Viechtbauer[18]generated2 \u00d72tablesbysamplingfromapairofbinomialdistributions.Inapply- ing the asymptotic variance formula to estimate the within-study variances, he added 0.5 to each cell;but,surprisingly,theformulaforthe effect sizeestimatedid not includeany suchadjustment. Often given as a percentage, I2has the advantage that its scaling does not change with the scaling of Q. In the setting of a random-effects model in which the within-study variance of each xiis\ud835\udf0e2and the between-study heterogeneity is \ud835\udf0f2, Higgins and Thompsonintroduced I2as an estimate of \ud835\udf0f2 \ud835\udf0f2+\ud835\udf0e2 (in practice, the within-study variance differs among studies, and \ud835\udf0e2is estimated by a \u2018typical\u2019 within- studyvariance,discussedinthesucceedingtext).Thequantity \ud835\udf0f2/(\ud835\udf0f2+\ud835\udf0e2)\u2018hasanappealinginterpre- tation as the proportion of total variation in the estimates of treatment effect that is due to heterogeneitybetweenstudies.\u2026Thisinterpretationmaybemadeapproximatelyforthestatistic I 2inthegeneralcase Copyright \u00a92015 John Wiley&Sons, Ltd.

C.HOAGLIN [inwhichthewithin-studyvariancediffersamongstudies].\u2019Withthisformulationof I2,thenullhypoth- esis that\ud835\udf0f2=0 implies that I2=0, and it is easy to interpret a positive value of I2as representing heterogeneity. Even if the null distribution of Qwere chi-squared on k\u22121 degrees of freedom, the probability of values exceeding the mean ( k\u22121)would not be small. That is, values of I2that would be interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity are quite likely under the assumed chi-squared null distribution, which corresponds to absence of heterogeneity. Referring that value of Qto the chi-squared distribution on 4 degrees of freedom produceda P-valueof0.049,whereasthegammadistributionfittedtothefirsttwomomentsoftheactual null distribution of Qproduced a P-value of 0.076. If one desires to retain E[ Q] under the null hypothesis as the threshold for positive values of I2,t h e nE [ Q] will have a separate expression for each measure of effect, and, further, each meta-analysis (with the same measure of effect) will potentially yield a different estimate of E[ Q] (with variability totakeintoaccount). Because theyusethe moment-basedestimateof \ud835\udf0f2[20], \u0302\ud835\udf0f2 DL=Q\u2212(k\u22121) \u2211wi\u2212\u2211w2 i\u2211wi (with\u0302\ud835\udf0f2 DL=0w h e n Q<k\u22121), the definition of s2is precisely the one that makes the two expressions forI2equivalent: \u0302\ud835\udf0f2 \u0302\ud835\udf0f2+\u0302\ud835\udf0e2=Q\u2212(k\u22121) Q.

To overcome this, for small H, [they] take a standard error based on the approximate variance of ln (Q\u2215(k\u22121)) =2ln(H)when Qtruly has a \ud835\udf122distribution with k\u22121 degrees offreedom(formula26.4.36in Abranowitz [sic]andStegun [22]): SE0[ln(H)] =\u221a{ 1 2(k\u22122)( 1\u22121 3(k\u22122)2)} Usingone or theother of thesestandarderrors,a95per cent uncertainty interval for Hfollows as exp(lnH\u00b11.96\u00d7SE[ln(H)])\u2019. Although the null distribution of Qis not chi- squared on k\u22121 degrees of freedom, the following comments retain that assumption because Higgins andThompsonusedit. (1) Miettinen[23]devisedtest-basedconfidencelimitstoavoidcomplexcalculations.Heobtainedthe standard error by standardizing a variance-stabilized function of the point estimate and equatingthe square of that quantity and the value of another statistic that tested the same null hypothesis andhadthechi-squareddistributionon1degreeoffreedomasitsnulldistribution.Inthisinstance, thetwostatisticshave(approximately)thestandardnormaldistribution.Theright-handsideoftheequation, (ln(Q)\u2212ln(k\u22121))\u2215SE[ln(Q)],arisesfromremovingsomeoftheskewnessinthedistri- bution of Qby taking the logarithm, subtracting the mean, and dividing by the standard deviation toobtainaquantitywhoseasymptoticdistribution(asthenumberofdegreesoffreedombecomeslarge)isstandardnormal.ThensolvingforSE [ln(Q)]yieldsthetest-basedestimateofthestandard error.Unfortunately,Halperin[24]andGreenland[25]showedthatthetest-basedapproachisfal-lacious.Theconfidenceintervalinvolvingthetest-basedstandarderrorisvalidonlyunderthenullhypothesis.

C.HOAGLIN HigginsandThompsonusedsimulationtocomparecoverageofseveralmethodsofobtainingconfidence intervals for H. (They did not, however, say precisely what data they generated or how.) Those results may reflect bias in the test-based estimate of the standard error of ln(H). Thus, considering also the fact that the null distribution of Qis not chi-squared on k\u22121 degrees of freedom, the width of the resulting confidence interval for I2may not reflect heterogeneity when heterogeneity is present. Fortwoversionsofthestandardizedmeandifference,Huedo-Medina et al.[28]studiedaspectsofthe performanceof I 2inrelationtothenumberofindividualstudies,theaveragesamplesizeinthosestudies, the between-studies variance, the ratio of the within-study variance in the experimental group to that inthe control group, and the distribution of individual scores in the two groups. Their simulation sampled true means for the experimental group ( \ud835\udf07 E=\ud835\udf03i)from the random-effects distribution \ud835\udf03i\u223cN(0.5,\ud835\udf0f2), generated random samples of scores for the experimental and control groups (with nE=nC),a n dt h e n calculatedthegroupmeansandwithin-groupstandarddeviations.Thesestepsplausiblyparalleltheway in which data for a meta-analysis might arise. The basic data came from a meta-analysis of 70 trials givenbyOlkin[30].Theirrandom-effectsmodelintroducedan M-foldincreaseintheprecisionofeach study-level estimate (correspondingtoan M-foldincreaseinsamplesize): xM,i=\ud835\udf07+\u221a \ud835\udf0e2 i/M+\ud835\udf0f2ti; for\ud835\udf07, they used the overall estimate from the initial meta-analysis; for \ud835\udf0e2 i,t h e yu s e d s2 i(the within-trial sampling variance); for \ud835\udf0f2, they used the DerSimonian\u2013Laird estimate of the heterogeneity parame- ter (\u0302\ud835\udf0f2 DL),a n d ti\u223cN(0,1). This approach may be reasonable for the intended purpose, but it involves approximations that create some distance from the process underlying the data in the trials. According tolarge-sampletheory,thedistributionofthelogoftheoddsratioapproachesanormaldistribution,butthe total sample sizes of the 70 trials range from 18 to 17,187 with a median of 111.5 and quartiles of 52 and 313. In order to use the customary formula for the asymptotic variance of log(OR), one must modify 2 \u00d72 tables that contain a zero cell.

DerSimonian and Kacker [31] proposed a general method-of-moments estimate for \ud835\udf0f2.F o ra n yfi x e d positive constants a1,\u2026,ak, they define ya=\u03a3iaiyi/\u03a3iai; equate Qa=\u03a3iai(yi\u2212ya)2to its expected value, expressed in terms of \ud835\udf0f2,t h e\ud835\udf0e2 i, and the ai;s o l v ef o r \ud835\udf0f2; and substitute s2 1,\u2026,s2 kfor\ud835\udf0e2 1,\u2026,\ud835\udf0e2 k. In most of their illustrative special cases, however, aiis a function of s2 i, rendering the derivation of the expected value of Qainvalid. For example, Hartung and Knapp [34] and, separately, Sidik and Jonkman [35] developed an alternative procedure for the overall mean effect and based their test and confidence interval on the t-distributionwith k\u22121degreesoffreedom.IntHout et al.[36]showed,bysimulation,thattheHartung\u2013 Knapp\u2013Sidik\u2013Jonkman method consistently had more-adequate coverage than the DerSimonian\u2013Lairdmethod. Unfortunately, the Hartung\u2013Knapp\u2013Sidik\u2013Jonkman method uses the DerSimonian\u2013Lairdpoint estimate of the overall mean effect, which has potential for bias, and the analysis of IntHout et al.w a s unableto reveal bias. Discussion Theimpetusforthispapercamefromreadingseveralarticlesthatused\u2018Cochran\u2019s Qtest\u2019;someofthem citedCochran\u2019s1954paper.Havingreadthatpaper,Iwassurprised.Itseemedclearthatthoseauthorshad notstudiedthatpaper.Iftheyhad,theywouldhaveknownthatCochrandeliberatelydidnotuse Qitself to test for the presence of heterogeneity (in the form of interactions\u2014actually experiment effects) and that thenull distributionof Qonlyapproaches chi-squaredon k\u22121degrees of freedomasymptotically. Ofcourse,useof Qtotestforheterogeneityhasbecomewidespread,andmanybooksandpaperssay that the null distribution is chi-squared on k\u22121 degrees of freedom (and do not mention that it is only approximate,needinglargewithin-studysamplesizes).Thus,readers,seeingareferencetoCochran[1], caneasilyarriveat\u2018Cochran\u2019s Qtest\u2019.InformationfromCochran\u2019spaper,togetherwithresultsfromthe workofKulinskaya et al.[13,14],providesanaccuratedescriptionofthebehaviorof Qandshouldhelp tocounteract someof the widespreadmisinformation. What they should do instead is the subject of ongoing research.As mentioned in Section 4, however, reasonable answers are available for several common measures of effect. For the standardized mean difference, one can refer Qto a chi-squared distribution whose degreesoffreedom(usuallynotaninteger)isestimatedbyusingacomplicatedexpansiontoapproximate E[Q], the theoretical expected value of Q. To minimize the computational burden, Kulinskaya et al. [14] developed software in R. In their examples, E[ Q] is somewhat less than k\u22121, and the decrease is enough to affect the result of the test. For the risk difference, the null distribution of Qrequires a differentapproximation,basedonagammadistributionwhosemeanandvariancematchthoseof Q[13]. The log of the odds ratio poses a greater challenge, but it has a simpler answer. As a basis for approximating the distribution of Q by a gamma distribution, the expansion for E[ Q] is satisfactory (after an adjustment), but the expansion Copyright \u00a92015 John Wiley&Sons, Ltd.

HOAGLIN for E[ Q2] is woefully inaccurate. Instead, they use the results of extensive simulations to approximate var[Q] closely as a quadratic function of E[ Q]. Then matching on the mean and variance produces a gamma-distribution approximation for the null distribution of Q. The distribution of Qis approximately (in large samples), and not exactly, chi-squared because the weights are 1/s 2 iand not 1/\ud835\udf0e2 i. In theoretical work, it is customary to assume that one can use the s2 i as if they were the \ud835\udf0e2 i; but this assumption can lead to problems, and it is supported by little, if any, empirical evidence in moderate and small samples. Thus, results that rely on this assumption (such as those claiming to derive the exact distribution of Cochran\u2019s Q)are mainly of theoretical interest; their relevance to actual meta-analyses remains unproven. These unnecessarily restric- tive choices are unfortunate, because they prevent the simulation from producing desirable empiricalinformation on the behavior of Q(and,often, ofother statistics). And, even if the null distribution of Qwere chi-squared on k\u22121 degrees of freedom, it would be an overstatement to interpret all values of Qthat exceed its mean ( k\u22121)as evidence of heterogene- ity. That choice tends to produce biased estimates of \ud835\udf0f2(e.g., Malzahn et al. [40], Sidik and Jonkman [41]) and has the potential for substantial bias in the pooled estimate of effect size (e.g.,Emerson et al.[32],Raghunathan and Ii[42],B\u00f6hning et al. [43], and Hamza et al.[44]). From the starting point of Qand \u2018Cochran\u2019s Qtest\u2019, the path of this paper has led naturally to two otherwidelyusedmethods, I2andtheDerSimonian\u2013Lairdprocedure.Allthreehaveshortcomings,some potentially serious, that point to a need for modifications in the current practice of meta-analysis.
