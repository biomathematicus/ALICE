    "description": "The Data and AI Intensive Research with Rigor and Reproducibility (DAIR-3) program is funded by Award 5R25GM151182 of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, one of the 27 institutes of the National Institutes of Health of the United States. The principal investigators are Jing Liu (University of Michigan) and Juan B. Guti\u00c3\u00a9rrez (University of Texas at San Antonio). \\nThe rigor of scientific research and the reproducibility of research results are essential for the validity of research findings and the trustworthiness of science. However, research rigor and reproducibility remains a significant challenge across scientific fields, especially for research with complex data types from heterogeneous sources, and long data manipulation pipelines. This is especially critical as data science and artificial intelligence (AI) methods emerge at lightning speed and researchers scramble to seize the opportunities that the new methods bring.  \\n\\nWhile researchers recognize the importance of rigor and reproducibility, they often lack the resources and the technical know-how to achieve this consistently in practice. With funding from the National Institutes of Health, a multi-university team offers a nationwide program to equip faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences with the skills needed to improve the rigor and reproducibility of their research, and help them transfer such skills to their trainees. \\n\\nTrainees will then be guided over a one-year period to incorporate the newly acquired mindset, skills and tools into their research; and develop training for their own institutions.  \\n\\nThe DAIR3 team and instructors include faculty and staff research leaders from the University of Michigan, the College of William and Mary, Jackson State University, and University of Texas San Antonio. This highly diverse team will model the culture of diversity that we promote, and will support trainees who are demographically, professionally and scientifically diverse, and are from a diverse range of institutions, including those with limited resources.",

      "summary": "\u2022Meta analysis is a speci\ufb01c type of research synthesis in which the aim is to quantify a speci\ufb01c parameter or test a speci\ufb01c hypothesis of interest, using results from multiple quantitative sources, and objectively assessing uncertainty for all claims. If $H$ is the harmonic mean of the study-level variances, then the standard deviation of the inverse variance weighted average is $H\u02c6{1/2}/\\sqrt{2}$. \u2022If we are pooling $k$ independent estimates, the standard error of the inverse variance weighted average is $H\u02c6{1/2}/\\sqrt{k}$, where $H$ is the harmonic mean of the $k$ study-level variances. \u2013Include both negative and positive \ufb01ndings \u2013Reporting of quantitative \ufb01ndings (point estimates, standard errors) \u2013Reporting of methods \u2013De\ufb01nition of target study population, and inclusion/exclusion criteria \u2013Handling of confounding factors \u2013Generally exclude studies that are themselves research syntheses \u2013Multiple studies of the same subject pool are not independent \u2013Multiple studies by the same research team may not be independent \u2013Is it possible to include unpublished studies (pre-registration may make this possible) \u2013Publication language \u2013Select by date? \u2013The fact that underpins most p-value combining procedures is that if the null hypothesis is true, the p-value follows a uniform distribution on the interval $(0, 1)$. Under the global null hypothesis, $T$ follows a standard Cauchy distribution, and therefore can be transformed to a p-value using the CDF of the reference distribution. \u2022To account for study heterogeneity, a common approach to meta-analysis is therandom e\ufb00ects orhierarchical approach, in which we posit the model $\\hat{\\theta}_i = \\theta_i + s_i\\epsilon_i$, where the $\\theta_i$ are treated as random variables from a distribution with mean $\\theta$ and variance $\\tau\u02c62$, and the $\\epsilon_i$ are also random variables that are independent of the $\\theta_i$ and that follow a distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1$. If truncation is performed, the bias is positive, and is around 0.15 for very small meta-analyses, and becomes smaller as the number of studies in the meta-analysis grows. If study or study/arm characteristics are known, let $Z_{ij}$ be a vector of characteristics for arm $j$ in study $i$, and use a mean structure model such as $E[Y_{ij}] = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + \\gamma\u02c6\\prime Z_{ij}$ The overall model would be $Y_{ij} = E[Y_{ij}] + s_{ij}\\epsilon_{ij}$, where $s_{ij}$ is the reported standard error for $Y_{ij}$ and the $\\epsilon_{ij}$ are independent unit-standard deviation random terms capturing unexplained variation. When there are large number of treatments, we can visualize the data as a graph, where treatments $j$ and $k$ are connected in the graph if these two treatments are ever present in the same trial. This refers to the possibility that inconclusive studies or studies that contradict the dominant narrative are less likely to be published than studies that support the consensus point of view. \u2022If all studies are assessing the same e\ufb00ect, then the scatter of the standard error of the estimated treatment e\ufb00ect (on the vertical axis) against the estimated treatment e\ufb00ect (on the horizontal axis) can be used to assess publication bias. \u2022Some funnel plots use the precision as the vertical coordinate rather than the standard error (the precision is the reciprocal of the standard error)."

Trial-level analysis in the overall study population We used Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression analyses to relate the  treatment effects on the clinical endpoint to the treatment effects on the total and chronic GFR slopes across the 66 studies 41. The slope of the meta-regression line was \u22120.35\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per  1.73\u2009m2 per year (95% BCI \u22120.42 to \u22120.29), indicating that a 0.75\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121  per 1.73\u2009m2 per year greater beneficial effect of the treatment on the  total GFR slope is associated with an average 23.3% lower HR for the clin - ical endpoint (95% BCI 19.3\u201327.2%). The intercept of the meta-regression  was \u22120.04 (95% BCI \u22120.09 to 0.01), indicating that, in the absence of a  treatment effect on the 3-year total slope, the average treatment effect  on the clinical endpoint is likely to be small (that is, 95% probability for  the HR to be between 0.91 and 1.01). The slope of the meta-regression line dif- fered substantially from 0, at \u22120.33 (95% BCI \u22120.46 to \u22120.20), indicating  that a 0.75\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year greater beneficial treatment  effect on the total GFR slope is associated with an average 21.8% lower  hazard for the clinical endpoint (95% BCI 14.1\u201329.4%). The intercept of  the regression line is nearly indistinguishable from 0 (\u22120.01, 95% BCI  \u22120.10 to 0.10), indicating low risk of a false-negative conclusion of the  absence of a treatment effect on the clinical endpoint when there is no  treatment effect on chronic slope (that is, 95% probability for the HR to be between 0.90 and 1.10). Together, these data have the potential to strengthen the evidence  for the validity of GFR slope as a surrogate endpoint for kidney failure,  providing support for its use as a primary endpoint for trials of CKD  progression across a broad series of settings. Studies of patients with CKD from other causes or cause not speci - fied reported lower mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  than the studies of patients with diabetes, glomerular diseases (glo - merulonephritis (GN)) or cardiovascular disease (CVD), and studies of  patients with CVD reported lower levels of urine albumin-to-creatinine  ratio (ACR) and slower progression than the other disease groups (Table 1   and Supplementary Table 4). Treatment effects on the GFR slope and the clinical endpoint Patterns of change in GFR (GFR slope) after initiation of an interven - tion are often nonlinear, with possibly differing direction and rates  of changes in early follow-up (herein called acute slope) versus  longer-term follow-up (herein called chronic slope)39. We used a shared-parameter  mixed-effects model to estimate the effects of the treatment on the  total GFR slope at 3\u2009years (herein called 3-year total slope), as this was the approximate mean length of the included studies and on chronic slope, computed from 3\u2009months after randomization 8,40. The median inter- cept of the meta-regressions for both chronic slope and total slope  were now negative and had credible intervals that did not overlap 0,  indicating that, on average, a modest benefit on the clinical endpoint  may be present in the absence of a treatment effect on GFR slope. For both  the 3-year total slope and the chronic slope, for each disease group the  BCIs for the meta-regression slopes do not cross 0, and the BCIs for the  meta-regression intercepts do cross 0 (Table 2  and Fig. CKD refers to diseases other than diabetes or glomerular disease or cause not yet specified.Nature Medicine | Volume 29 | July 2023 | 1867\u20131876 1870 Analysis https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02418-0there is a suggestion of modest heterogeneity among the posterior  distribution of the meta-regression slopes (range for median slope  from \u22120.24 for diabetes to \u22120.48 for CVD) and intercepts (range for  median intercept from \u22120.12 for GN to 0.04 for CVD) across the dis - ease groups but with widely overlapping BCI. Assessment of model adequacy and outliers We evaluated model adequacy and identified potential outliers by  comparing, for each study, the observed HRs for the clinical end - point to the posterior predictive distribution (PPD) for the esti - mated treatment effect on the clinical endpoint computed under  a meta-regression model fit with that study left out. For the 3-year  total slope, nine (13.6%) of 66 studies had observed HRs that fell out - side of the middle 90% intervals of the PPD; for the chronic slope,  10 (15%) of the observed HRs fell outside of the 90% intervals (Sup - plementary Table 8). Prediction intervals and positive predictive value For application of these results to the use of slope as a surrogate end- point in a future trial, we applied the above meta-regression results to  compute Bayesian prediction intervals (BPIs) that provide a 95% prob - ability of including the true treatment effect on the clinical endpoint,  for varying estimated treatment effects on the slope endpoints for  hypothetical large (total sample size of 1,600), medium (total sample size of 800) and small (total sample size of 400) trials.As expected, with greater treatment benefit on GFR slope, the  estimated treatment benefit on the clinical endpoints also increases  (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 11). For example, in a large future trial, the 95% BPI for the HR on  the clinical endpoint associated with an estimated treatment effect  of 0.75\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year definitively excludes an HR of 1 or  greater for the 3-year total slope (0.60\u20130.89) but not the chronic slope  (0.51\u20131.18). Similarly, the threshold for a treatment effect on the GFR  slope to assure the posterior probability of a clinical benefit, which  we defined as an HR for the clinical endpoint of less than 1, of greater  than or equal to 97.5% is substantially smaller for the 3-year total slope  than for the chronic slope (0.44\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year versus  1.26\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year). Within the different disease groups, the 95% BPI for the HR on  the clinical endpoint associated with an estimated treatment effect  of 0.75\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year is also wider for the chronic slope  than for the 3-year total slope (Extended Data Table 7). The magnitude  of the difference is smaller for the CKD (chronic slope versus 3-year  total slope (0.54\u20130.96) versus (0.57\u20130.90)) and diabetes ((0.63\u20131.13)  versus (0.59 to 0.93)) disease groups compared to that for the CVD  ((0.30\u20131.52) versus (0.61\u20130.97)) and GN ((0.34\u20131.12) versus (0.52\u20130.95))  disease groups. We found that with analysis of  GFR slope using a robust method for each study, treatment effects on  the total slope computed at 3\u2009years accounted for an estimated 97%  of the variation between studies in treatment effects on the clinical  endpoint, with similar results across CKD severity and diverse disease  groups. Our results indicate potential concerns with the use of the chronic  slope, which ignores the acute effect of a drug on the GFR slope\u2014an  indication that the acute reduction in GFR due to treatment initiation  might affect the clinical endpoint. Together, these data pro - vide the necessary evidence to support use of total GFR slope in RCTs  evaluating therapies of CKD progression as a valid, fit-for-purpose and  robust surrogate endpoint that can be presented to regulatory agen- cies for approval for marketing authorization, to payors to support funding of these therapies and to healthcare professionals and patients  to inform of their benefit in slowing CKD progression and preventing  kidney failure. The  earlier analyses demonstrated that treatment effects on chronic  slope accounted for a median 96% (95% BCI 63\u2013100%) of the varia - tion between studies in treatment effects on the clinical endpoint,  similar to that of the total slope in those prior analyses (97% (95% BCI  78\u2013100%)) (ref. Because the total slope includes both the acute and  chronic GFR slope, the superior performance of total slope compared  to chronic slope in the current analysis of a more diverse set of studies  suggests that the acute effect might be correlated with a component  of the primary clinical endpoint.

The observation of weaker associations for chronic slope in the  CVD group might suggest that the less favorable results for the chronic  slope in the current analysis compared to earlier analyses may be  related to inclusion of these studies. The strength of this  evidence is indicated in the lower limit for the 95% credible interval  for the trial-level R2 of 0.82, an increase from 0.78 in our prior results,  now substantially exceeding the threshold of 0.72 proposed for a  strong surrogate43. First, we evaluated the associa - tion between the treatment effects on GFR slope and on the clinical end - points ascertained over the average follow-up period of approximately  3 years for the trials included in our analysis. Second, our calcula - tions of the prediction intervals and trial-level positive predictive  value (PPV) for a future trial assume that the relationship between the  treatment effects on the slope and clinical endpoints is similar between  the future trial and the previously conducted trials. Studies should evaluate it as  an indicator of treatment effects before widespread use in clinical trials.Table 3 | Application of GFR slope as a surrogate endpoint in a new RCT: predicted treatment effect on clinical endpoint   and PPV GFR slope Observed treatment  effect on change in GFR  slopeLarge RCT Medium RCT Small RCT Median HR and 95% BPIPPV trial Median HR and  95% BPIPPVtrial Median HR and 95% BPIPPV trial Total slope computed at  3\u2009years0.5 0.80 (0.66, 0.98) 0.98 0.80 (0.62, 1.03) 0.96 0.80 (0.58, 1.12) 0.91 0.75 0.74 (0.60, 0.89) 1.00 0.74 (0.57, 0.94) 0.99 0.74 (0.53, 1.02) 0.97 1 0.68 (0.54, 0.82) 1.00 0.68 (0.52, 0.86) 1.00 0.68 (0.48, 0.93) 0.99 Threshold for treatment effect on GFR slope  associated with 97.5% probability of clinical  benefit0.44 0.58 0.79 Chronic slope0.5 0.84 (0.55, 1.28) 0.80 0.84 (0.54, 1.32) 0.78 0.84 (0.51, 1.40) 0.75 0.75 0.78 (0.51, 1.18) 0.89 0.78 (0.49, 1.22) 0.87 0.78 (0.47, 1.29) 0.84 1 0.72 (0.47, 1.09) 0.94 0.72 (0.45, 1.12) 0.93 0.72 (0.43, 1.18) 0.91 Threshold for treatment effect on GFR slope associated with 97.5% probability of clinical  benefit1.26 1.35 1.51 Units of GFR are ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2.

The  selection of total slope versus chronic GFR slope, and the duration of time   over which the total GFR slope is computed, should be made with con- sideration of the study design, population and intervention under inves - tigation and in the context of the specific drug development program. Overview Our meta-analytic approach followed seven main steps: (1) search and  identify data from published RCTs using a standardized approach; (2)  obtain agreement for use of individual data and transfer to the Data  Coordinating Center at Tufts Medical Center or identify methods  for cloud-based data access; (3) within each RCT, use intent-to-treat  analyses to estimate (a) the effect of the treatment on GFR slope under  a shared-parameter mixed-effect model and (b) the effect of the treat - ment on clinical endpoint (defined as a composite of kidney failure,  sustained GFR\u2009<\u200915\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 or doubling of serum creatinine)  under a Cox proportional hazards regression model; (4) quantify the  association between treatment effects on the GFR slope and treatment  effects on clinical endpoints across RCTs using trial-level Bayesian  meta-regression analysis; (5) identify outliers and evaluate model ade- quacy across the individual trials by using a cross-validation approach  to compare the observed treatment effect on the clinical endpoint in  each trial to the PPD for that trial derived from the trial-level model fit to the remaining trials; (6) quantify the consistency in these associa-tions across disease subgroups using Bayesian meta-regression with partial pooling; and (7) assess the utility of using slope as a surrogate  endpoint in a future trial by providing 95% Bayesian prediction intervals  and trial-level PPVs corresponding with a range of possible treatment effects on the slope endpoint in a hypothetical future trial. The analytic approach is based on the causal association frame - work in which the validity of surrogate endpoints is evaluated based on  the relationship between the average causal effect of the treatment on  the surrogate endpoint and the average causal effect of the treatment  on the clinical endpoint across a population of RCTs. Confidence in the use  of these results for a future new trial is increased when the previously  conducted trials provide evidence that the treatment effect on the  clinical endpoint is consistently predicted from the treatment effect on  the surrogate across a broad collection of RCTs evaluating treatments  that operate through diverse mechanisms and across diverse patient  populations. In comparison to the prior analyses, the current set of studies includes populations with higher mean levels of GFR and populations at high risk for CVD.For each study, we defined the active treatment as the treatment  hypothesized to produce the greater reduction in the risk of the clini- cal endpoint. The exclusion of doubling of serum creatinine from the  secondary clinical endpoint assures that the remaining components  of the composite endpoint signify the occurrence or near-occurrence  of a kidney failure, considered to be the true clinical event, and reduces  the chance that that endpoint would be affected by large acute effects. Compared to the primary clinical endpoint, the secondary clinical  endpoint poses several challenges for our trial-level analyses, includ-ing: (1) treatment effects are estimated with reduced precision due to  fewer events, reducing statistical power, particularly for subgroup  analyses; (2) trial-level analyses are weighted even more heavily toward  the subgroup of trials with lower levels of baseline GFR, as KFRT and  GFR\u2009<\u200915\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 are rare events for trials with high baseline  GFR; and (3) the competing risk of death will have a greater impact. For these reasons, the composite of KFRT and GFR\u2009<\u200915\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per  1.73\u2009m2 is treated as the secondary clinical endpoint, and the broader  composite, which includes doubling of serum creatinine in addition  to these two events, is designated as the primary clinical endpoint in these analyses. Differences  between the randomized groups in the mean GFR levels at 3-month  follow-up, the mean slopes from 3\u2009months onward and the estimated  mean changes from baseline to either 2-year or 3-year follow-up fac - tored by the follow-up duration represented the treatment effects on  the acute, chronic and total slopes, respectively. In studies in which at least 15  individuals died or reached KFRT, the model accounts for informative  censoring by these events by incorporating the mixed model for the  GFR measurements within a shared-parameter model in which the risk  of KFRT or death was assumed to be related to the random slopes and  intercepts of the GFR part of the model62,63. As described above, we applied the mixed-effects models to estimate the treatment effects on GFR slope  within each study by treatment arm, with treatment effects expressed  as differences in the mean GFR slopes between the treatment versus  control groups in units of ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year. We next applied a trial-level Bayesian  mixed-effects meta-regression model to relate the treatment effects  on the clinical endpoint to the treatment effects on GFR slope with  study as the unit of analysis41,50. The model relates the treatment effects  on the two endpoints after accounting for the standard errors in the  estimated effects in each study and the correlation of these errors  with each other. The model includes two stages, where the  first stage relates the estimated treatment effects to the true latent  treatment effects within each trial and the second stage describes  the relationships between the true latent treatment effects across the  different trials. We let  \u03b8i and \u03b3i denote the true latent treatment effects on the clinical endpoint  and on the GFR slope in the i th trial and use \u0302\u03b8i and \u0302\u03b3i to indicate the  estimated effects obtained as described above. The first stage of   the model relates the estimated and true latent treatment effects in  the ith trial by: [\u0302\u03b8i \u0302\u03b3i]\u223cMVN([\u03b8i \u03b3i],[\u03c32 iri\u03c3i\u03b4i ri\u03c3i\u03b4i\u03b42 i]) Here, \u03c3i is the standard error of the estimated treatment effect on  the clinical endpoint; \u03b4i is the standard error of the estimated treatment effect on GFR slope in the i th trial; and ri is the correlation between these  estimated treatment effects. The second stage of the model characterizes the variation in the  true latent treatment effects on GFR slope and on the clinical endpoint  across the trials. This second stage is expressed as [\u03b8i \u03b3i]\u223cN([\u03bc\u03b8 \u03bc\u03b3],[\u03c32 \u03b8R\u03c3\u03b8\u03c3\u03b3 R\u03c3\u03b8\u03c3\u03b3\u03c32 \u03b3]) where \u03bc\u03b8 and \u03bc\u03b3 are, respectively, the means of the true latent treatment  effects on the clinical endpoint and on GFR slope in the population of  trials represented by this meta-regression; \u03c3\u03b8 and \u03c3\u03b3 are the standard  deviations of the true latent treatment effects across the population of trials; and R is the correlation between the true latent treatment effects  on the two endpoints. Based on this two-stage model, the slope and  intercept of the meta-regression line predicting the true latent treatment  effect on the clinical endpoint from the true latent treatment effect on  the surrogate endpoint are given by \u03b2\u2009=\u2009R\u03c3\u03b8/\u03c3\u03b3 and \u03b1\u2009=\u2009\u03bc\u03b8\u2009\u2212\u2009\u03b2\u03bc\u03b3, respec - tively, and the residual standard deviation or RMSE, which defines the  uncertainty in the treatment effect on the clinical endpoint given a par- ticular treatment effect on the surrogate endpoint, is RMSE = \u03c3\u03b8\u00d7(1\u2212R2)1 2. The priors for the mean treatment effects on the clinical endpoint  (expressed as a log HR) and on each GFR slope endpoint (expressed as  difference between treatment arms in ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year)  were taken to be normal distributions each with mean 0 and variance  10,000; the priors for the variances of the treatment effects on the  clinical endpoint and on the GFR slope endpoints were each taken to  be inverse gamma distributions with shape parameter 0.261. The prior distribution for the clinical endpoint was  selected by the investigators to assign 1/3 prior probabilities each to  low treatment effect heterogeneity (which we defined as a treatment effect standard deviation on the log-scale \u22640.05), medium treatment  effect heterogeneity (defined as a treatment effect standard deviation  on the log-scale between 0.05 and 0.20) and high treatment effect  heterogeneity (defined as a treatment effect standard deviation on  the log-scale >0.20). We checked that the  prior distributions had only a small influence on the results by verifying  that the results of each analysis were similar under alternative inverse  gamma (0.001, 0.001) prior distributions for the variances for the  treatment effects on the clinical endpoint and on GFR slope. The meta-regression supports the validity of GFR slope  as a surrogate endpoint if (1) the slope of the meta-regression line has a large magnitude with a BCI that does not cross 0; (2) the intercept is  close to 0 and with a BCI that crosses 0, implying absence of a substan - tial average effect on the clinical endpoint when the treatment does Nature Medicine Analysis https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02418-0not affect GFR slope; and (3) the R2 of the meta-regression is large,  indicating strong associations (for example, >0.72) (ref. The meta-regression slope provides the mean difference in the log  HR for the clinical endpoint associated with each 1\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2  per year increment in the treatment effect on the GFR slope endpoint. The meta-regression intercepts provide the estimated mean log HR  for the clinical endpoint when the mean treatment effect on the GFR  slope endpoint is equal to 0. To assist with interpretation, we express  the impact under the meta-regression model of a 0.75\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per  1.73\u2009m2 difference in the treatment effect on GFR slope on the HR for  the treatment effect on the clinical endpoint using the formula: %DifferenceinHRforclinicalendpoint =100\u00d7(1\u2212exp(0.75 \u00d7(meta\u2212regressionslope ))) For example, a 0.75\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121 per 1.73\u2009m2 per year greater beneficial  effect of the treatment on the 3-year total GFR slope is associated with  an average 23%\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u00d7\u2009(1\u2009\u2212\u2009exp(0.75\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u22120.35)) lower HR for the clinical  endpoint. In the extended partial-pooling model, the first stage again describes the relationship between the estimated treatment effects and the true latent treatment effects on the slope and clinical endpoints within each trial. The second stage includes separate meta-regressions that describe the relationship between the true latent treatment effects on the slope and clinical endpoints across the studies within each of the designated subgroups of trials. When the data suggest a small amount of variation in a particular meta-regression term (such as the meta-regression slope or intercept) between the subgroups, then the subgroup-specific posterior distributions for that term will be more distinct between subgroups due to a lesser degree of information sharing. For each study, we pro - duced a PPD for the estimated treatment effect on the clinical endpoint  based on the estimated treatment effect on GFR slope in that study and  the meta-regression model fit to the remaining trials with that study  held out. We graphically displayed the  actual observed effect on the clinical endpoint to an interval extending  from the 5th to the 95th percentile of the PPD for each trial, to display  how well the trial-level model predicts the treatment effect in a \u2018new  trial\u2019 based on a model developed from the remaining trials. We obtained 95% prediction  intervals for the treatment effect on the clinical endpoint given a par- ticular value for the true latent treatment effect on GFR slope by simu- lating the posterior distribution of \u03b1  + \u03b2  \u00d7 True.Effslope  + \u03940, where True. Effslope  is the true latent treatment effect on the GFR slope endpoint;   \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u00d7 True.Effslope  represents the predicted mean true latent treatment  effect on the clinical endpoint based on the meta-regression model;  and \u03940 is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation  given by the RMSE from the meta-regression. This prediction interval accounts for uncertainty in the estimation  of \u03b1 and \u03b2  and in the RMSE that defines the meta-regression, as well  as uncertainty due to variation in the treatment effects on the clinical endpoint about the regression line for different trials. When the trial-level meta-regression is applied to a newly con - ducted randomized trial, there is an additional source of uncertainty  that results from imprecision in the estimation of the treatment effect  on GFR slope in the new trial. We obtained 95% prediction intervals for the true latent treatment  effect on the clinical endpoint in a new trial that take into account this additional uncertainty by again sampling from the posterior distribu- tion of \u03b1  + \u03b2  \u00d7 True.Effslope  + \u03940, but now assume that True.Effslope  has a  random distribution to reflect the uncertainty in its estimation in the  new trial instead of taking True.Effslope  to be a fixed value. Specifically, we  assumed that the posterior distribution of True.Effslope  is normally dis- tributed with mean equal to the estimated treatment effect on GFR slope  and standard deviation given by the standard error for the estimated  treatment effect on GFR slope based on the sample size. We used a similar sampling approach for the posterior distribution  of \u03b1 + \u03b2  \u00d7 True.Effslope  + \u03940 to estimate the probability that the treatment  effect of the clinical endpoint in the new trial, expressed as a log HR,  would fall below 0 (corresponding to a non-zero treatment benefit  with an HR for the clinical endpoint less than 1) given either the true  or the estimated treatment effects on GFR slope in the new trial. By considering the PPV as a function of  the estimated treatment effect on GFR slope, we determined the size of the smallest treatment effect on GFR slope that would be required to assure a PPV of at least 0.975 for a benefit on the clinical endpoint.

The mean GFR was lower in older age by 20.72 ml/min per 1.73 m 2per year (95% con\ufb01dence interval [95% CI], 20.96 to 20.48) for men who were healthy versus 21.03 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year (95% CI, 21.25 to 20.80) for men who were unhealthy, and by 20.92 ml/min per 1.73 m2per year (95% CI, 21.14 to 20.70) for women who were healthy versus 21.22 ml/min per 1.73 m2per year (95% CI, 21.43 to 21.02) for women who were unhealthy.

Our aims were to study the association of GFR with age in healthy people and predict reference intervals for GFR in healthy aging acrosst h es t u d i e da g er a n g e .B e c a u s ei tw o u l dn o tb ep o s s i b l et operform a population-based study with a high number of trulyhealthy individuals in the oldest age groups, we designed thestudy to use a generalized additive regression model to adjustfor the association of comorbidity and risk factors with GFRand to predict the distribution of GFR in hypothetically healthy persons. Three eligiblecohorts were identi \ufb01ed: the Renal Iohexol Clearance Survey (RENIS) in Troms\u00f8 6 (RENIS-T6; n51632); 21the Berlin Ini- tiative Study (BIS; n5610);22and the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility \u2013Kidney Study (AGES-Kidney; n5819) (Figure 1).23 The RENIS cohort included a repeated GFR measurement in the RENIS follow-up study (RENIS-FU) after a mean follow- up of 5.6 years ( n51329).24The examinations in RENIS-T6 and RENIS-FU were both included in this investigation. The RENIS cohort included participants between 50 and 63 years of age at baseline from the sixth wave of a series ofpopulation surveys in the municipality of Troms\u00f8 in northernNorway. AGES-Kidney is a substudy of the AGES-II-Reykjavik Study, which was a follow-up of the population-based Reykjavik Study in Iceland.23T h er e s p o n s er a t ei nt h eA G E S - I I - R e y k j a v i kS t u d yw a s 71%,26and for those eligible for AGES-Kidney the response rate was 65%.23 The inclusion criteria for the three cohorts were similar, except AGES-Kidney excluded individuals receiving active cancer treatment, and BIS excluded persons that requirednursing care during daytime and nighttime. The people invited to AGES-Kidney and RENIS comprised random samples of the general population, and those invited to BIS comprised a random sample from the Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse Nordost , which provides insurance cover- age to almost 50% of people older than 70 years in Berlin.22 Although participation was voluntary, the three cohorts ofexamined persons were all representative of their source pop-ulations. The prevalence of the most important chronic diseases in BIS was similar to that of all persons older than 70 years in the Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse Nordost .28Also, the prevalence of diabetes,29myocardial infarction,30angina pectoris,30 stroke,31and cancer32were of a similar order of magnitude as in other German studies of chronic diseases in older adults. The participants in AGES-Kidney were younger, had lower systolic BP, and were less likely to be current smokers or have cardiovascular disease or diabetes than participants in AGES-II-Reykjavik who were not included.23The meanSigni \ufb01cance Statement In populations, mean GFR is lower in older age, but whether healthy aging is associated with preserved rather than lower GFR in some individuals is unknown. The mean and the 97.5th percentile of the GFR distribution were higher in older persons who were healthy than in those who wereunhealthy, but lower than in middle-aged people who were healthy.The GFR-age association was more negative in women than in men. 38The iohexol assays of the three studies were calibrated by reanalyzing thawed samples in the laboratory of the Department of Medical Biochemis- try, University Hospital of North Norway (UNN; Troms\u00f8,Norway). 38No calibration was found to be necessary for the BIS and RENIS samples, but the following equation was usedto calibrate the AGES-Kidney results to the UNN laboratory:log(iohexol UNN)520.09111.0253log(iohexol AGES).38This calibration resulted in a mean difference in GFR of only 0.87 ml/min from the original results. 33,36,40 eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine(eGFRcrea) using the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation.41 Statistical Analyses Characteristics of the study participants were provided at thetime of the GFR measurements, i.e., characteristics for the RENIS cohort was reported for both the baseline (RENIS-T6) and the follow-up (RENIS-FU) examination. 42The associations between GFR indexed for body surface area andage, sex, health status, and cohort membership were exploredin generalized additive regression models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) using the gamV procedure from the mgcViz-package in R. 43,44 GAMLSS is a new regression method suitable for modeling the age-dependent distribution of variables. In brief, the mean andSD of the GFR distribution are modeled as separate functionsof the independent variables in the same regression model. In addition to investigating the association of the independent variableswith the mean of the GFR distribution as in ordinary regres-sion methods, GAMLSS makes it possible to investigate theirassociation with the SD of the distribution. The GFR-age associ-ation was de \ufb01ned as the difference in mean GFR per 1-year older age and is represented by the coef \ufb01cient for the age vari- able in the regression model. 45This criterion scores the models for \ufb01t to the data, but penalizes the score for the number of independent variables and complexity of the model. We\ufb01rst analyzed both the mean and the SD of the GFR distribution as functions of the main effects of age, sex, and thehealth status variable. In this model, statistically signi \ufb01cant main effects of all of the independent variables and the age-health status interac-tion were found for the mean of GFR ( P,0.05). To investigate the possibility of different associations be- tween age and GFR distributions across the cohorts, we in-cluded random effects for the interaction between age andcohort in the functions for both the mean and the SD ofGFR. This means that the GFR-age associations may differ between the cohorts, and adding this effect to the func-tion for the mean of the model improved the \ufb01t (AIC533306.61). Next, we tested interactions between age and sex, and health status and sex, for both the mean and SD in this model.Only the interaction between age and sex for the mean wasstatistically signi \ufb01cant ( P50.005). This was done for boththe mean and SD of GFR, but model \ufb01t was no better for these models than for the model without nonlinear terms(AIC533302.98 for the interaction between age and healthstatus; AIC 533304.35 for age and sex). Table 2 shows the observed median and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles for GFR according to the health statusvariable for each of the cohorts. Using GAMLSS regression, we analyzed the mean and the SD of the GFR distribution as functions of age, sex, cohort,and the health status variable (Table 3, Supplemental Table 3).The intercept of the model corresponds to the GFR estimatefor a 50-year-old woman who is unhealthy (Table 3).

We repeated the analyses of the model shown in Table 3 with nonindexed GFR, measured in ml/min, as the dependentvariable and height and weight added as independent vari-ables. Measurements for both the baseline (RENIS-T6) and the follow-up examinations (RENIS-FU) of the same persons in the RENIS cohort are shown.

A similar \ufb01nding regarding the 95th percentile was observed in a study of po-tential living kidney donors by Chakkera et al. 59The results a r ea l s oc o n s i s t e n tw i t hh i s t o l o g i c \ufb01ndings in biopsies from living kidney donors, which indicate that nephron number islower at older age even in people who are apparently healthy,although the study by Denic et al. 6only included persons younger than 75 years and may not be representative of older healthy people in the general population. However, the study may have been biased by the use of creat- inine clearance for assessing GFR and the inclusion of patientswith diabetes in the healthy group.

Because weadjusted for the heterogeneity between the cohorts, the predic-tions represent an average of the observations in three differentgeographic regions.A comparison between classi \ufb01cation of low GFR based on the 2.5th percentile for persons who are healthy in thisstudy and the currently accepted criterion for CKD stage 3\u20135( G F R ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) shows that the criterion underestimates the prevalence of low GFR in women youn-ger than 67.1 years and in men younger than 70.8 years, andoverestimates the prevalence at higher ages (Figure 3).However, this is the result of applying a low percentile andar a t h e rs t r i c td e \ufb01nition of \u201chealthy \u201dto assess the effect of age on GFR under optimal physiologic conditions. Although the low number of persons who werehealthy in the highest age groups may have limited the powerof statistical tests for the interaction between age, health status, and other variables, it seems unlikely that we have failed to include a signi \ufb01cant number of very old persons who were healthy with preserved GFR that would have changed ourconclusion. 88However, even allowing for great variation and possible nonlinear individual GFR trajectories, the \ufb01nding that the 2.5th percentile in 50-year-old people who are healthy is sim-ilar to the 97.5th percentile in 95-year-old people who arehealthy (Figure 3) suggests that aging with preserved GFRacross this age span must be very uncommon.

In what follows, in the hope of correcting the misunderstandings, Section 2 gives the definition of Q and discusses its customary use in meta-analysis. Definition of Q In a meta-analysis of kstudies, the basic ingredients for Qare the studies\u2019 estimates of the effect and the estimated standard errors of those estimates. In the notation of Cochran [1], the effect estimate fromStudy iisx i,andthecorrespondingestimatedstandarderroris si(i=1,\u2026,k).Qmeasuresheterogeneity of the xiby summarizing their variation around a weighted mean, \u0304xw, in which the weight for xiis the reciprocal ofits estimated variance, wi=1\u2215s2 i: \u0304xw=\u2211k i=1wixi/\u2211k i=1wi. Cochran\u2019s1954 paper For an understanding of Q, it is helpful to examine the setting in William Cochran\u2019s 1954 paper, \u2018The Combination of Estimates from Different Experiments\u2019 [1]: \u2018This paper discusses one of the simpleraspects of the problem, in which there is sufficient uniformity of experimental methods so that the ith experiment provides an estimate x iof\ud835\udf07and an estimate siof the standard error of xi.

[illustrationsofinteractionsomitted]thecombinationofthe individual estimates is not a routine matter, but requires clear thinking about both the nature of the data and the function of the combined estimate. For the sorts of xithat Cochran discusses, the degrees of freedom ordinarily come from a mean square (e.g., the sample variance or the residual mean square of a regression). The development in Cochran\u2019s paper has implications for the distribution of Q, the standard error of \u0304xw, estimationofthe variance of the \ud835\udf07i, and potential bias in \u0304xw.

They present fairly general expansions for the first two moments of Qin terms of the weights and the moments of the estimators of the two parameters. )Asanexample,theyapplytheirexpansionstotheriskdifference.On the basis of extensive simulations, they recommend approximating the null distribution of Qby a gammadistributionwhosefirsttwomomentsequaltheestimatesderivedfromtheexpansions.Theyfindthat the resulting test for homogeneity is substantially more accurate than the usual chi-squared test and other tests,especially when thestudies\u2019samplesizes aresmall or moderate. If, for example, the measure of effect size is the log of the odds ratio, they can (for each replication) calculate the study-specificestimates and their estimated variances, as the definition of Qrequires. On the other hand, in a study of confidence intervals (based on Qand other approaches) for the amount of heterogeneity in random-effects meta-analysis, with log-odds-ratio as the measure of effectsize,Viechtbauer[18]generated2 \u00d72tablesbysamplingfromapairofbinomialdistributions.Inapply- ing the asymptotic variance formula to estimate the within-study variances, he added 0.5 to each cell;but,surprisingly,theformulaforthe effect sizeestimatedid not includeany suchadjustment. In the setting of a random-effects model in which the within-study variance of each xiis\ud835\udf0e2and the between-study heterogeneity is \ud835\udf0f2, Higgins and Thompsonintroduced I2as an estimate of \ud835\udf0f2 \ud835\udf0f2+\ud835\udf0e2 (in practice, the within-study variance differs among studies, and \ud835\udf0e2is estimated by a \u2018typical\u2019 within- studyvariance,discussedinthesucceedingtext).Thequantity \ud835\udf0f2/(\ud835\udf0f2+\ud835\udf0e2)\u2018hasanappealinginterpre- tation as the proportion of total variation in the estimates of treatment effect that is due to heterogeneitybetweenstudies.\u2026Thisinterpretationmaybemadeapproximatelyforthestatistic I 2inthegeneralcase Copyright \u00a92015 John Wiley&Sons, Ltd.

C.HOAGLIN [inwhichthewithin-studyvariancediffersamongstudies].\u2019Withthisformulationof I2,thenullhypoth- esis that\ud835\udf0f2=0 implies that I2=0, and it is easy to interpret a positive value of I2as representing heterogeneity. Even if the null distribution of Qwere chi-squared on k\u22121 degrees of freedom, the probability of values exceeding the mean ( k\u22121)would not be small. If one desires to retain E[ Q] under the null hypothesis as the threshold for positive values of I2,t h e nE [ Q] will have a separate expression for each measure of effect, and, further, each meta-analysis (with the same measure of effect) will potentially yield a different estimate of E[ Q] (with variability totakeintoaccount).

Thus, considering also the fact that the null distribution of Qis not chi-squared on k\u22121 degrees of freedom, the width of the resulting confidence interval for I2may not reflect heterogeneity when heterogeneity is present.

DerSimonian and Kacker [31] proposed a general method-of-moments estimate for \ud835\udf0f2.F o ra n yfi x e d positive constants a1,\u2026,ak, they define ya=\u03a3iaiyi/\u03a3iai; equate Qa=\u03a3iai(yi\u2212ya)2to its expected value, expressed in terms of \ud835\udf0f2,t h e\ud835\udf0e2 i, and the ai;s o l v ef o r \ud835\udf0f2; and substitute s2 1,\u2026,s2 kfor\ud835\udf0e2 1,\u2026,\ud835\udf0e2 k. In most of their illustrative special cases, however, aiis a function of s2 i, rendering the derivation of the expected value of Qainvalid. Unfortunately, the Hartung\u2013Knapp\u2013Sidik\u2013Jonkman method uses the DerSimonian\u2013Lairdpoint estimate of the overall mean effect, which has potential for bias, and the analysis of IntHout et al.w a s unableto reveal bias. To minimize the computational burden, Kulinskaya et al. [14] developed software in R. In their examples, E[ Q] is somewhat less than k\u22121, and the decrease is enough to affect the result of the test. As a basis for approximating the distribution of Q by a gamma distribution, the expansion for E[ Q] is satisfactory (after an adjustment), but the expansion Copyright \u00a92015 John Wiley&Sons, Ltd. Statist. That choice tends to produce biased estimates of \ud835\udf0f2(e.g., Malzahn et al.
