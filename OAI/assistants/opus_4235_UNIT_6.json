    "general_instructions": "The DAIR-3 program, funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, is led by Jing Liu and Juan B. Guti√©rrez. It aims to improve scientific rigor and reproducibility, especially in research involving complex data and long processing pipelines. These challenges are heightened by the fast pace of developments in data science and AI, which many researchers are not fully equipped to handle with consistent methodological soundness. \\n To address this, DAIR-3 offers a year-long national training program for faculty and technical staff in biomedical sciences. Participants gain skills to enhance the quality of their research and train others at their institutions. The program is delivered by a diverse team from multiple universities, with a focus on supporting individuals from varied backgrounds and under-resourced institutions. \\n The output of each request must be a response that guides the student in understanding a topic. When answering with LaTeX notation, use $ and $$ to enclose expressions; this include single commands, e.g. \\sigma, which should appear as $\\sigma$ do NOT use any other enclosure for equations. When using LaTeX notation, ensure that variables, cefficients and contants are enclosed by blank spaces. "

      "summary": "Meta-analysis is a quantitative research synthesis method that pools results from multiple studies to estimate parameters or test hypotheses with increased precision. It typically uses weighted averages of effect estimates, often based on inverse variance, to improve accuracy. Meta-analyses handle study heterogeneity through fixed or random effects models and can incorporate meta-regression to explore moderators. Network meta-analysis enables indirect comparisons across multiple treatments. Study selection must consider bias, including publication bias, often assessed via funnel plots. Proper methodology ensures meta-analysis strengthens evidence by combining data while addressing variability and potential biases across studies."
